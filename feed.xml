            <title>Elementary OS 8 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/999910/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.elementary.io/os-8-available-now/">Version
8</a> of the Ubuntu-based <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary OS</a> has been released. This
release includes a rewritten Dock, new window-management features,
improvements in the installation and initial setup procedures for
visually impaired users, as well as a new Secure Session mode:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
In the Secure Session, apps will be more restricted and will require
your consent for access to system features. When an app wants to
listen in the background for your keystrokes, take a screenshot,
record the screen, or even pick up the color from a single pixel, you
will be asked first to make sure that it's okay. The Secure Session
also comes with other modern features like support for Mixed DPI
modes—A hotly requested feature for folks using a HiDPI notebook or
tablet with a LoDPI external display—and improved support for
multi-touch gestures on touch screens and tablets.

            <title>A kernel code of conduct enforcement action</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/999197/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The <a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/tab/start">Linux Foundation Technical
Advisory Board</a> (TAB) has <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/6740fc3aabec0_5eb129497@dwillia2-xfh.jf.intel.com.notmuch/">decided</a> to "<q>restrict Kent Overstreet's
participation in the kernel development process during the Linux 6.13
kernel development cycle</q>" based on a recommendation from the <a
href="https://kernel.org/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct
committee</a>.  In particular, the scope of the restriction will be to "<q>decline all pull
requests from Kent Overstreet</q>" during the development cycle.
Overstreet is the creator and maintainer of the <a
href="https://bcachefs.org/">bcachefs</a> filesystem.

<p>
This
action stems from a <a 
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/citv2v6f33hoidq75xd2spaqxf7nl5wbmmzma4wgmrwpoqidhj@k453tmq7vdrk/">message</a>
Overstreet posted back in early September that was abusive toward another
kernel developer; there is a fair amount of back-and-forth about the
incident and the committee's attempts to extract a public apology from
Overstreet in that thread.  Overstreet has published a <a
href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/116412665">lengthy blog post</a>
describing his side of the story.]]></description>

Programming language polyglots are files that are valid
programs in multiple languages, and do different things in each. While polyglots are normally
nothing more than a curiosity, the
<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html">
Cosmopolitan Libc</a> project has been trying
to put them to a novel use: producing native, multi-platform binaries that
run directly on several operating systems and architectures. There are still
some rough edges with the project's approach, but it is generally possible to
build C programs into a polyglot format with with minimal
tweaking.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://github.com/bit-team/backintime?tab=readme-ov-file#back-in-time">
Back In Time</a> is a GPL-2.0-licensed backup tool based on
<a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">
rsync</a> and written in Python. It has both graphical and command-line interfaces, and
supports backups to local disks or over SSH.
Back In Time was originally written by
Oprea Dan and released in 2009. The tool has been
through some rough patches over the years, and is currently on its third set of
maintainers. Christian Buhtz, one of the current maintainers, explained to me
how he and his co-maintainers had revived the project, as well as why he thought
Back In Time stood out from all of the existing backup solutions.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/995915/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Fedora Linux, as a rule, handles version upgrades reasonably
well. However, there are times when users may want to do a fresh
installation rather than an upgrade <em>but</em> preserve existing
users and data under <tt>/home</tt>. This is a scenario that the
Fedora installer, currently, does not address. Users can maintain a
separate <tt>/home</tt> partition, of course, but the installer does
not incorporate existing users into the new install&mdash;that is an
exercise left to the user to handle. One solution might be to use <a
href="https://systemd.io/HOME_DIRECTORY/">systemd-homed</a>, a systemd
service for managing users and home directories. However, a discussion
proposing the use systemd-homed as part of Fedora installation
uncovered some hurdles, such as trying to blend its approach to
managing users with tools that centralize user management.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Flexible arrays — arrays that are declared as the final member of a
structure and which have a size determined at run time — have long drawn
the attention of developers seeking to harden the kernel against
buffer-overflow vulnerabilities.  These arrays have reliably been a source
of bugs, so anything that can be done to ensure that operations on them
stay within bounds is a welcome improvement.  While many improvements,
including the recent <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/936728/">counted-by work</a>, have
been made, one of the most difficult cases remains.  Now, however,
developers who are interested in using recent compiler bounds-checking
