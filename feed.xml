href="https://blog.centos.org/2024/12/introducing-centos-stream-10/">announced</a>
the general availability of CentOS&nbsp;Stream&nbsp;10. See the <a
href="https://centos.org/centos10/">release notes</a> for information
on new features, changes, and removed software. The Extra Packages for
Enterprise Linux (EPEL) 10 repository is also <a
href="https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/epel-10-is-now-available/">available</a>,
and will be adding minor version repositories:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
For the EPEL 9 release, we started building packages about six months
before the RHEL 9 release by using CentOS Stream 9 as the initial
build environment. For EPEL 10, we're expanding on that approach and
doing the same thing for each minor version of RHEL 10. We will have
separate DNF repositories for each minor version of RHEL 10, including
CentOS Stream 10 as the leading minor version. Packages built for one
minor version will carry forward to the next minor version. You can
find more details about this structure in our <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/branches/">branching documentation</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><a
href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/11/kubernetes-v1-32-release/">Version
1.32</a> (dubbed "Penelope") of <a
href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> has been released with 13
major features graduating to Stable status, 12 entering Beta, and 19
entering Alpha.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
If Kubernetes is Ancient Greek for "pilot", in this release we start
from that origin and reflect on the last 10 years of Kubernetes and
our accomplishments: each release cycle is a journey, and just like
Penelope, in "The Odyssey", weaved for 10 years -- each night removing
parts of what she had done during the day -- so does each release add
new features and removes others, albeit here with a much clearer
purpose of constantly improving Kubernetes.

of the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1001215/">compromise</a> of

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>PyPI staff and volunteers do their best to remove malware, but
because the service is open to anyone looking to publish software
there is an unfortunately high amount of abuse. Thankfully most of
this abuse does not have the same widespread impact as a targeted

<p>Mike Fiedler, the PyPI Safety and Security Engineer is working on
new systems for reducing the time that malware is available to be
installed on PyPI, through <a

that security researchers can automatically send reports</a> to and

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998783/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Linux offers two broad ways of performing I/O to files.  Buffered I/O,
which is the usual way of accessing a file, stores a copy of the
transferred data in the kernel's page cache to speed future accesses.
Direct I/O, instead, moves data directly between the storage device and a
user-space buffer, avoiding the page cache.  Both modes have their
advantages and disadvantages.  In 2019, Jens Axboe <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806980/">proposed an uncached buffered mode</a> to get some
of the advantages of both, but that effort stalled at the time.  Now, <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20241203153232.92224-2-axboe@kernel.dk">uncached buffered
I/O is back</a> with some impressive performance results behind it.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/997784/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The traditional structure of a compiler forms a pipeline — parsing,
type-checking, optimization, and code-generation, usually in that order. But
modern programming languages have requirements that are ill-suited to such a
design. Increasingly, compilers are moving toward other designs in
order to support incremental compilation and low-latency responses for uses
like integration into IDEs. Rust has, for the last eight years, been pursuing a
particularly unusual design; in that time
compile times have
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/dashboard.html">
substantially improved</a>, but there's still more work to be done.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998778/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> is popular as a <a
href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch-based_distributions">base
for other Linux distributions</a>; examples of Arch-derivatives include <a
href="https://endeavouros.com/">EndeavourOS</a>, <a
href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro</a>, <a
href="https://www.parabola.nu/">Parabola</a>, and <a
href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos">SteamOS</a>.
There's one small problem: the control files used to describe how to build
packages for Arch Linux have no stated license. That creates a bit of
uncertainty about the rights and responsibilities for the downstream
derivatives. So far, that doesn't seem to have been a problem, nor has
it stopped other projects from assuming that reuse is
allowed. However, the Arch project is looking to add some clarity by
explicitly assigning a liberal license to its package
sources. Currently the project is in the process of reaching out to
contributors to see if they have any objections.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998115/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The Linux kernel community's discussions about including Rust have
<a href="https://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/#Development_tools-Rust">
gotten a lot of attention</a>, but the kernel is not the only project wrestling
with the question of whether to allow Rust. The Git project
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/git/ZZ77NQkSuiRxRDwt@nand.local/">
discussed</a> the prospect in January, and then
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Zu2DmS30E0kKug2a@nand.local/">
again</a> at the Git Contributor's Summit in September. Complicating the
discussion is the Git project's lack of a policy on platform
support, and the fact that it does already have tools written in other
languages.
While the project has not committed to using
or avoiding Rust, it seems like only a matter of time until maintainers will
have to make a decision.

need to upgrade.

            <title>Systemd 257 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001657/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Systemd 257 has been released.  As usual, the list of changes is long; it
includes support for multipath TCP in socket units, the ability to run
processes as init in their own PID namespace, a new tool for signing EFI
binaries for secure boot,
and a superhero emoji in the run0 shell prompt, among many other things. 
Also, support for version-1 control groups has been disabled and requires
an elaborate dance to re-enable; it will be removed entirely in the next
release, along with support for System&nbsp;V service scripts.]]></description>

            <title>A change of hats! (Fedora Magazine)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001634/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Fedora Project Leader (FPL) Matthew Miller <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-project-leader-matthew-miller-a-change-of-hats/">writes</a> that he will soon be hanging up the FPL hat:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Stay tuned for a job posting from Red Hat, and details about all
that. I'm hoping we can hire someone awesome early in 2025, and make
the official handover on the release of auspiciously-numbered Fedora
Linux 42.</p>

<p>I'm not going to leave Fedora, though. As I said above, although it
might not always feel like it from the outside, Red Hat support for
Fedora is stronger than ever, and I plan on helping that grow even
more. I'm stepping into a full-time management role in the Community
Linux Engineering organization, so Fedora will still be part of my day
job, just in a different way.</p>

            <title>GNU Shepherd 1.0.0 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001599/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/news/2024/12/the-shepherd-1.0.0-released/">Version
1.0.0</a> of the GNU Shepherd service manager has been released after a
mere 21&nbsp;years of development.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	This 1.0.0 release is published today because we think Shepherd has
	become a solid tool, meeting user experience standards one has come
	to expect since systemd changed the game of free init systems and
	service managers alike. It's also a major milestone for Guix, which
	has been relying on the Shepherd from a time when doing so counted
	as dogfooding.
