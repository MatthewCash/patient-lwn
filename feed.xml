            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/970824/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On April 21, a group of anonymous authors and non-anonymous signatories published
<a href="https://save-nix-together.org/">a lengthy open letter</a> to the
<a href="https://nixos.org/">
Nix</a> community
and Nix founder Eelco Dolstra calling for his resignation from the project. They
claimed ongoing problems with the project's leadership, primarily focusing on the
way his actions have allegedly
undermined people nominally empowered to perform various
moderation and governance tasks. Since its release, the letter has gained
more than 100 signatures.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/970565/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Video playback is undeniably one of the most important features in modern
consumer devices. Yet, surprisingly, users are by and large unaware of the
intricate engineering involved in the compression and decompression of
video data, with codecs being left to find a delicate balance between image
quality, bandwidth, and power consumption. In response to constant
performance pressure, video codecs have become complex and hardware
implementations are now common, but programming these devices is becoming
increasingly difficult and fraught with opportunities for exploitation. I
hope to convey how Rust can help fix this problem.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/970907/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[At the CPU level, a memory model describes, among other things, the amount
of freedom the processor has to reorder memory operations.  If low-level
code does not take the memory model into account, unpleasant surprises are
likely to follow.  Naturally, different CPUs offer different memory models,
complicating the portability of certain types of concurrent software.  To
make life easier, some Arm CPUs offer the ability to emulate the x86 memory
model, but efforts to make that feature available in the kernel are running
into opposition.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/970397/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On April 11, Brandt Bucher posted
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0744">PEP 744</a> ("JIT Compilation"),
which summarizes the current state of Python's new <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958350/">
copy-and-patch just-in-time (JIT) compiler</a>. The JIT is currently
experimental, but the PEP proposes some criteria for the circumstances under which it
should become a non-experimental part of Python.
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-744-jit-compilation/50756">
The discussion</a> of the PEP hasn't
reached a conclusion, but
several members of the community have already raised questions
about how the JIT would fit into future iterations of the Python language.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/972680/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Go Blog has <a href="https://go.dev/blog/chacha8rand">a detailed
article</a> on the new, more secure random-number generator implemented for
the 1.22 release.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	For example, when Go 1.20 deprecated math/rand's Read, we heard
	from developers who discovered (thanks to tooling pointing out use
	of deprecated functionality) they had been using it in places where
	crypto/rand's Read was definitely needed, like generating key
	material. Using Go 1.20, that mistake is a serious security problem
	that merits a detailed investigation to understand the
	damage. Where were the keys used? How were the keys exposed? Were
	other random outputs exposed that might allow an attacker to derive
	the keys? And so on. Using Go 1.22, that mistake is just a mistake.
