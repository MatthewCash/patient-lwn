action and expecting different results.  Be that as it may, LWN has
repeatedly started a new year with a set of predictions, only to have to
review how badly they went at the end.  There was no break in that pattern
this year, so there is no help for it; the time has come to review

            <title>[$] Systemd takes steps toward a more secure boot process</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001730/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The systemd project has been working for some time on
<a href="https://0pointer.net/blog/brave-new-trusted-boot-world.html">
promoting</a>
<a href="https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/unified_kernel_image/">
unified kernel
images</a> (UKIs), a format that bundles a kernel, initial disk image, kernel command line, and
other associated data into a single file. The advantage of the format is the ability to
authenticate the entire collection with secure boot, which makes it easier for
end users to know that their operating system hasn't been tampered with. The
downside is the lack of flexibility and increase in disk usage, since all of the
things packaged in a UKI must be updated together. But the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1001657/">
recent systemd 257 release</a> (along with other changes to be covered in a
future article) includes some
major changes to the UKI format, and the rest of the boot process, that
partially mitigate those downsides. The release also includes improvements for
hardware-locked disk encryption, which may also help secure some computers.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1002340/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[In the past, suspensions of Python core developers have effectively been
permanent because the recipients of the punishment chose not to return.
Things have played out quite differently after Tim Peters was <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/988894/">suspended for three months</a> back in August;
Peters has been posting to the Python discussion forum since his suspension
ended in early November and, generally, getting back to work as usual.
That does not mean that he—or others in the community—have accepted the way
he was treated, but he has largely made his peace with it.  The incident is
still reverberating through the Python world, however.]]></description>

got distracted, and the work did not progress.  Now, Gabriel Krisman
Bertazi has returned with <a

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Fedora Engineering Steering Council (FESCo) has made a series of
missteps in deciding to revoke a longtime Fedora contributor's <a
href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Provenpackager_policy/">provenpackager</a>
status. FESCo made the decision during a closed session, based on private
complaints. It then publicly announced its decision, including the
contributor's name, while only supplying a vague account of the
contributor's actions. This has left the Fedora community with more
questions than answers, and raised a number of complaints about the
transparency of FESCo's process. In addition, the sequence of events has
sparked discussions about package ownership, as well as when and how it's
appropriate to push changes to packages that a developer doesn't own.</p>]]></description>

            <title>2024: Year in Review (Tor Blog)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1004460/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a> has <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/2024-year-in-review/">published a
review</a> of major milestones from 2024, including <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-tails-join-forces/">merging with
the Tails project</a>, work to enable human-friendly <tt>.onion</tt>
addresses, and the launch of <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-webtunnel-evading-censorship-by-hiding-in-plain-sight/">WebTunnel</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
By mimicking common internet protocols, WebTunnel improves the
resilience of the Tor network in regions with heavy censorship. And
since its launch earlier this year, we've made sure to prioritize
small download sizes for more convenient distribution and simplified
the support of uTLS integration further mimicking the characteristics
of more widespread browsers. This makes Webtunnel safe for general
users because it helps conceal the fact that a tool like Tor is being
used.

	Work on relieving the rtnl_lock pressure has continued throughout

	categories – converting read operations to rely on RCU protection

	into per-network namespace locks (preparations for which started in

<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	We've been hard at work since Android 15's release in September,
	adapting our unique features to this new version of
	Android. Android 15 introduced several complex changes under the
	hood, but due to our previous efforts adapting to Google's
	UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14, we were able to
	rebase onto Android 15's code-base faster than anticipated.
<p>
	Additionally, this is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a
	device perspective we have seen in years. This means that many more
	devices are ready on day one that we'd typically expect to have up
	this early in the cycle!
<p>
	Last, but not least, we even had enough time and resources to
	introduce not one, but two new exciting apps! The first one,
	Twelve, will replace our aging music app, while the other one,
	Camelot, will let you view PDF files.

<blockquote class="bq">
	So we had a slight pickup in commits this last week, but as
	expected and hoped for, things were still pretty quiet. About twice
	as many commits as the holiday week, but that's still not all that
	many.
<p>
	I expect things will start becoming more normal now that people are
	back from the holidays and are starting to recover and wake up from
	their food comas.

            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://lineageos.org/Changelog-29/">Version 22.1</a> of the
Android-based LineageOS distribution is out.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	We've been hard at work since Android 15's release in September,
	adapting our unique features to this new version of
	Android. Android 15 introduced several complex changes under the
	hood, but due to our previous efforts adapting to Google's
	UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14, we were able to
	rebase onto Android 15's code-base faster than anticipated.
<p>
	Additionally, this is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a
	device perspective we have seen in years. This means that many more
	devices are ready on day one that we'd typically expect to have up
	this early in the cycle!
<p>
	Last, but not least, we even had enough time and resources to
	introduce not one, but two new exciting apps! The first one,
	Twelve, will replace our aging music app, while the other one,
	Camelot, will let you view PDF files.
