            <title>Fish shell announces 4.0 release</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1002820/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<tt>fish</tt> is a shell with a custom language and several affordances not available out of the box in other shells, such as directory-sensitive command completion. Although the project does not normally make beta releases, the 
<a href="https://fishshell.com/blog/fish-4b/">
newly announced 4.0 release</a>
will have one in order to ensure that no problems were introduced
<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/discussions/10123">
after a major effort to switch the code base from C++ to Rust</a>.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>
fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell with clever features that just work, without needing an advanced degree in bash scriptology. Today we are announcing an open beta, inviting all users to try out the upcoming 4.0 release.
</p>

<p>
fish 4.0 is a big upgrade. It's got lots of new features to make using the command line easier and more enjoyable, such as more natural key binding and expanded history search. And under the hood, we've rebuilt the foundation in Rust to embrace modern computing.

should be released before the end of the year. While nothing is etched
in stone just yet, it is a good time for anyone using or targeting
RHEL (and its clones) to start taking a look at how Stream&nbsp;10,
and the corresponding <a

repository, is shaping up. This is not only important to RHEL and
Stream users, but anyone deploying and supporting software on

and Rocky&nbsp;Linux as well.</p>]]></description>

            <title>[$] Auto-tuning the kernel</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998576/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The Linux kernel has many tunable parameters. While there is much advice
available on the internet about how to set them, few people have the time to
weed through the (often contradictory) explanations and choose appropriate
values. One possible way to address this is
<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/introducing-bpftune">
a project called bpftune</a>, a
program that uses BPF to track various metrics about a running system and
adjust the sysctl knobs appropriately. The program is developed by Oracle, and
is available under a GPLv2 license. Bpftune is currently mostly
focused on optimizing network settings, but the authors hope that the system is
flexible enough to be extended to cover other settings.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998893/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[In a session at
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open Source Summit Europe</a>
(OSSEU) back in September, Alex Bucknall gave an overview of a camera "trap"—a
device to capture images in a non-intrusive way—that he helped develop 
which is being used to monitor <a

the <a href="https://arribada.org/">Arribada Initiative</a>, which is a
non-profit organization
focused on creating open-source technology for studying wildlife and ecosystems.
The camera system uses the <a href="https://zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr</a>
realtime operating system (RTOS) on an open platform that is designed to be
inexpensive and usable for multiple applications.]]></description>

            <title>[$] Finally continuing the discussion over continue in finally</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1000635/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
In 2019, the Python community had a
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-601-forbid-return-break-continue-breaking-out-of-finally/2239">
lengthy discussion</a> about changing the rules (that some find counterintuitive) on
using <tt>break</tt>, <tt>continue</tt>, or <tt>return</tt> statements in
<tt>finally</tt> blocks. These are all ways of jumping out of a <tt>finally</tt>
block, which can interrupt the handling of a raised exception.
At the time, the Python developers chose not to change
things, because the consensus was that the existing behavior was not a problem. Now, after
<a href="https://github.com/iritkatriel/finally/blob/main/README.md">a
report</a> put together by Irit Katriel, the project is once again considering
changing the language.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1000654/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The <a
href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12.1/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L35"><tt>page</tt>
structure</a> sits at the core of the kernel's memory-management subsystem
(for now), and a key part of that structure is its reference count, stored
in <tt>refcount</tt>.  The page reference count tells the kernel how many
users a given page has and when it can be freed.  That count is not needed
for every page in the system, though.  Matthew Wilcox has recently <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20241125210149.2976098-1-willy@infradead.org">resurrected</a>
an <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-mm/20220809171854.3725722-1-willy@infradead.org/">old
patch set</a> that expands the concept of a "frozen" page — one that lacks a
meaningful reference count — to the immediate benefit of the slab allocator
but in the service of a longer-term goal as well.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1000485/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It has long been said that <a
href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html">naming things
is one of the hard things to do in computer science</a>. That may be
so, but it pales in comparison to the challenge of handling
usernames properly in applications. This is especially true when multiple
applications are involved, and they are all supposed to agree on what
characters are, and are not, allowed. The Debian project is facing
that problem right now, as two user-creation utilities disagreed about
which names are allowable. A plan is in place to sort this out
before the release of Debian&nbsp;13 ("trixie") sometime next year.</p>]]></description>

<tt>sq</tt>'s PKI is probably its most notable feature, and the one we invested
the most time in. The PKI is used to authenticate certificates, and
messages. Authentication is necessary to ensure that you are
encrypting to the person you think you are, and to identify who really
authored a message; without authentication, encryption and
verification are much weaker.

            <title>Kernel prepatch 6.13-rc3</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1002251/</link>

that doesn't actually seem to be the case - this looks very regular both in
number of commits and in diff size</q>".]]></description>
