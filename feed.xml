            <title>Manjaro 24.0 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/973686/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a
href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-24-0-wynsdey-released/161527">Version&nbsp;24.0</a>
of the Arch-based <a href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro</a> distribution is now available with
the 6.9&nbsp;kernel, GNOME&nbsp;46, Xfce&nbsp;4.18, and an update to the
<a href="https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Pamac">Pamac</a> package
installer. This is also the project's first release with KDE&nbsp;Plasma&nbsp;6:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The Plasma edition comes with the latest Plasma 6.0 series and KDE
Gear 24.02. It brings exciting new improvements to your desktop.</p>

<p>With Plasma 6, KDE's technology stack has undergone major upgrades:
a transition to the latest version of application framework, Qt, and
an improved graphics platform when Wayland is used. These changes are
as smooth and unnoticeable to the users as possible. You will see the
same familiar desktop environment that you know and love. But these
under-the-hood upgrades benefit Plasma's security, efficiency, and
performance, and improve support for modern hardware. Thus Plasma
delivers an overall more reliable user experience, while paving the
way for many more improvements in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The project also offers minimal install images with the 6.6&nbsp;LTS
and 6.1&nbsp;LTS kernels to support older hardware.</p>]]></description>

<a href="https://save-nix-together.org/">a lengthy open letter</a> to the
<a href="https://nixos.org/">
Nix</a> community
and Nix founder Eelco Dolstra calling for his resignation from the project. They
claimed ongoing problems with the project's leadership, primarily focusing on the
way his actions have allegedly
undermined people nominally empowered to perform various
moderation and governance tasks. Since its release, the letter has gained
more than 100 signatures.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/970565/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Video playback is undeniably one of the most important features in modern
consumer devices. Yet, surprisingly, users are by and large unaware of the
intricate engineering involved in the compression and decompression of
video data, with codecs being left to find a delicate balance between image
quality, bandwidth, and power consumption. In response to constant
performance pressure, video codecs have become complex and hardware
implementations are now common, but programming these devices is becoming
increasingly difficult and fraught with opportunities for exploitation. I
hope to convey how Rust can help fix this problem.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/970907/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[At the CPU level, a memory model describes, among other things, the amount
of freedom the processor has to reorder memory operations.  If low-level
code does not take the memory model into account, unpleasant surprises are
likely to follow.  Naturally, different CPUs offer different memory models,
complicating the portability of certain types of concurrent software.  To
make life easier, some Arm CPUs offer the ability to emulate the x86 memory
model, but efforts to make that feature available in the kernel are running
into opposition.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/970397/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On April 11, Brandt Bucher posted
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0744">PEP 744</a> ("JIT Compilation"),
which summarizes the current state of Python's new <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958350/">
copy-and-patch just-in-time (JIT) compiler</a>. The JIT is currently
experimental, but the PEP proposes some criteria for the circumstances under which it
should become a non-experimental part of Python.
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-744-jit-compilation/50756">
The discussion</a> of the PEP hasn't
reached a conclusion, but
several members of the community have already raised questions
about how the JIT would fit into future iterations of the Python language.
