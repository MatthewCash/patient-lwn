href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-opensearch-software-foundation-to-foster-open-collaboration-in-search-and-analytics">announced</a>
the creation of the <a
href="https://foundation.opensearch.org/">OpenSearch Software
Foundation</a> as a vendor&#8209;neutral home for the <a
href="https://opensearch.org">OpenSearch</a> search and observability

Established in 2021 and previously hosted by Amazon Web Services

downloads and participation from thousands of contributors and more
than 200 project maintainers.

<p>AWS <a

the OpenSearch project as an open-source fork of ElasticSearch and
Kibana in 2021 after Elastic <a

            <title>Valkey 8.0.0 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/990490/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://valkey.io/blog/valkey-8-ga/">Version 8.0.0</a> of
the <a href="https://valkey.io">Valkey</a> open-source in-memory data
store is now available. This is the first major release of Valkey
since the project <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/966631/">forked</a> from <a
href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> in March of this year:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
While this is a major version, Valkey takes command set compatibility
seriously: Valkey 8.0.0 makes no backwards incompatible changes to the
existing command syntax or their responses. Your existing tools and
custom software will be able to immediately take advantage of Valkey
8.0.0. Since Valkey 8.0.0 does make some small changes to previously
undefined behaviors, it's wise to <a
href="https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/blob/8.0.0/00-RELEASENOTES">read
the release notes</a>. Additionally, because this version makes changes in how the
software uses threading, you may want to re-evaluate your cluster's
infrastructure to achieve the highest performance.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/990264/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Germany's <a href="https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/">Sovereign
Tech Fund</a> (STF) has agreed to <a
href="https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/tech/samba">invest â‚¬688,800</a>
to improve the security, stability, and functionality of <a
href="https://www.samba.org/">Samba</a>. The investment will take
place over three years and will be managed by <a href="https://samba.plus/about-sernet">SerNet</a>, a company that
employs several Samba core developers and offers support for
Samba. According to its <a
href="https://samba.plus/blog/detail/sernet-secures-funding-for-samba-project-from-sovereign-tech-fund">announcement</a>,
work has already begun and is expected to complete in 2026:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
The project's focus is on areas like transparent failover, SMB3 UNIX
extensions, and modern security protocols such as SMB over QUIC. These
improvements are designed to ensure that Samba remains a robust and
secure solution for organizations that rely on a sovereign IT
infrastructure that is as independent as possible of proprietary
software regimes, but including optimal interoperability.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/988438/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Much of the early Rust code for the kernel has taken the form of
reimplementations of existing drivers as a proof of concept.  One project,
though, is entirely new: the driver for Apple GPUs written by Asahi Lina.
This driver has shipped with <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi
Linux</a> for some time and, by many accounts, is stable, usable, and a
shining example of how Rust can be used in a complex kernel subsystem.
That driver remains outside of the mainline kernel, though, and merging
currently looks like a distant prospect.  The reasons for that state of
affairs highlight some of the difficulties inherent in integrating a new
language (and its associated development style) into the Linux kernel.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/987315/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the joys of writing about technology is the opportunity to
cover interesting talks on open&#8209;source and free&#8209;software topics. One
of the pains is creating transcriptions of said talks, or continually
referring back to a recording, to be able to write about
them. <a href="https://github.com/mkiol/dsnote">Speech Note</a> is an
open-source application that uses machine-learning models, running locally, to
translate speech to text and take the pain out of transcription. It
also handles text to speech, and language translations. While not
perfect, its transcriptions are better than one might expect, even when
handling jargon, accents, and less-than-perfect audio.</p>]]></description>

	Radicle 1.0 represents the culmination of years of experimentation
	and hard work from our team and community, where we set out to
	ensure that free and open source software ecosystems can flourish
	without having to rely on the whims of Big Tech. We designed
	Radicle with a first-principles approach, as a natural extension to
	Git, expanding it to work in a collaborative, local-first,
	peer-to-peer setting.
