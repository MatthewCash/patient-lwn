the networking subsystem</a> in 2024.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Work on relieving the rtnl_lock pressure has continued throughout
	the year. The rtnl_lock is often mentioned as one of the biggest
	global locks in the kernel, as it protects all of the network
	configuration and state. The efforts can be divided into two broad
	categories – converting read operations to rely on RCU protection
	or other fine grained locking (v6.9, v6.10), and splitting the lock
	into per-network namespace locks (preparations for which started in
	v6.13).

            <title>LineageOS 22.1 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003862/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://lineageos.org/Changelog-29/">Version 22.1</a> of the
Android-based LineageOS distribution is out.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	We've been hard at work since Android 15's release in September,
	adapting our unique features to this new version of
	Android. Android 15 introduced several complex changes under the
	hood, but due to our previous efforts adapting to Google's
	UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14, we were able to
	rebase onto Android 15's code-base faster than anticipated.
<p>
	Additionally, this is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a
	device perspective we have seen in years. This means that many more
	devices are ready on day one that we'd typically expect to have up
	this early in the cycle!
<p>
	Last, but not least, we even had enough time and resources to
	introduce not one, but two new exciting apps! The first one,
	Twelve, will replace our aging music app, while the other one,
	Camelot, will let you view PDF files.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003607/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman has posted three new stable kernel updates:
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003608/">6.12.7</a>,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003609/">6.6.68</a>, and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003610/">6.1.122</a>. As usual, he warns that all users of
stable kernels must upgrade, although for many systems that seems unlikely to
happen until January.

            <title>LineageOS 22.1 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003862/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://lineageos.org/Changelog-29/">Version 22.1</a> of the
Android-based LineageOS distribution is out.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	We've been hard at work since Android 15's release in September,
	adapting our unique features to this new version of
	Android. Android 15 introduced several complex changes under the
	hood, but due to our previous efforts adapting to Google's
	UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14, we were able to
	rebase onto Android 15's code-base faster than anticipated.
<p>
	Additionally, this is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a
	device perspective we have seen in years. This means that many more
	devices are ready on day one that we'd typically expect to have up
	this early in the cycle!
<p>
	Last, but not least, we even had enough time and resources to
	introduce not one, but two new exciting apps! The first one,
	Twelve, will replace our aging music app, while the other one,
	Camelot, will let you view PDF files.

            <title>Cook: Colliding with the SHA prefix of Linux&apos;s initial Git commit</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003797/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Kees Cook <a
href="https://people.kernel.org/kees/colliding-with-the-sha-prefix-of-linuxs-initial-git-commit">describes
his work</a> resulting in a kernel documentation commit whose ID shares the
same first 12 characters as the initial commit in the kernel's repository.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	This is not yet in the upstream Linux tree, for fear of breaking
	countless other tools out in the wild. But it can serve as a test
	commit for those that want to get this fixed ahead of any future
	collisions (or this commit actually landing).

            <title>Three stable kernel updates</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003607/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman has posted three new stable kernel updates:
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003608/">6.12.7</a>,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003609/">6.6.68</a>, and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003610/">6.1.122</a>. As usual, he warns that all users of
stable kernels must upgrade, although for many systems that seems unlikely to
happen until January.

            <title>Ruby 3.4 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003547/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Continuing its tradition of yearly major releases on December 25, the <a
href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> programming-language project
has <a
href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/12/25/ruby-3-4-0-released/">released
Ruby 3.4.0</a> (followed quickly by <a
href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/12/25/ruby-3-4-1-released/">3.4.1</a>,
which simply updates the version number).  Ruby 3.4 includes lots of
changes, including the addition of <a
href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18980"><tt>it</tt></a> as a
less-confusing shorthand for <tt>_1</tt> as a block parameter, switching to
<a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20564">Prism as the default
parser</a>, adding the <a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8305">Happy Eyeballs
version&nbsp;2</a> algorithm to the socket library,
just-in-time (JIT) compiler (YJIT) improvements, garbage-collection
modularization, and more.]]></description>
