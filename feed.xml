            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/969908/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/967180">
The recent XZ backdoor</a> has sparked a lot of discussion about how the open-source
community links and packages software. One possible
security improvement being discussed
is changing how
projects like systemd link to dynamic libraries that are only used for
optional functionality: using
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html">
<tt>dlopen()</tt></a> to load those libraries only
when required. This could
shrink the attack surface exposed by dependencies, but the approach is not
without downsides â€” most prominently, it makes discovering which dynamic
libraries a program depends on harder.
On April 11, Lennart Poettering proposed one way to eliminate that problem
<a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/32234">
in a systemd RFC on GitHub</a>.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/969185/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Kumar Kartikeya Dwivedi has been working to add support for exceptions to BPF
since mid-2023. In July, Dwivedi posted
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/938435/">
the first patch set</a> in this effort, which adds support for basic stack unwinding.
In February 2024, he posted
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/bpf/20240201042109.1150490-1-memxor@gmail.com/">
the second patch set</a>
aimed at letting the kernel release resources held by the BPF program when an
exception occurs. This makes exceptions usable in many more contexts.

scheduler</a> was merged as an option for the 6.6 kernel.  It represents a

developer Peter Zijlstra has returned from a long absence to post <a

includes a significant behavioral change and a new feature intended to help

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/969383/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The kernel project merges dozens of drivers with every development cycle,
and almost every one of those drivers is entirely uncontroversial.
Occasionally, though, a driver submission raises wider questions, leading
to lengthy discussion and, perhaps, opposition.  That is currently the case
with two separate drivers, both with ties to the networking subsystem.  One
of them is hung up on questions of whether (and how) all device
functionality should be made available to user space, while the other has
run into turbulence because it drives a device that is unobtainable outside
of a single company.]]></description>

            <title>A new crash reporter for Firefox</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/971006/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On April 23, Mozilla
<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/04/porting-a-cross-platform-gui-application-to-rust/">
announced</a> that Firefox's crash reporter has been rewritten in Rust, allowing the
project to address a backlog of issues.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Even though it is important to properly handle main process crashes, the crash
reporter hasn't received significant development in a while (aside from
development to ensure that crash reports and telemetry continue to reliably be
delivered)! It has long been stuck in a local maximum of "good enough" and
"scary to maintain": it features 3 individual GUI implementations (for Windows,
GTK+ for Linux, and macOS), glue code abstracting a few things (mostly in C++,
and Objective-C for macOS), a binary blob produced by obsoleted Apple
development tools, and no test suite. Because of this, there is a backlog of
features and improvements which haven't been acted on.

BleepingComputer
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-comments-abused-to-push-malware-via-microsoft-repo-urls/">
reported</a> on April 20 that some malware was being distributed via GitHub.
Uploading files as part of a comment gives them a URL that appears to be
associated with a repository, even if the comment is never posted.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>
A GitHub flaw, or possibly a design decision, is being abused by threat actors
to distribute malware using URLs associated with Microsoft repositories, making
the files appear trustworthy.
</p>

<p>
While most of the malware activity has been based around the Microsoft GitHub
URLs, this "flaw" could be abused with any public repository on GitHub, allowing
threat actors to create very convincing lures.

	eBPF was originally written for network packet filters but as of
	kernel v6.3 and thanks to Benjamin, we have BPF in the HID

	complicated things like "toggle that bit to zero" or "swap those
	two values".
