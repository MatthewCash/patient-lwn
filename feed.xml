he's maintained PCRE, and its successor PCRE2, for more than 27
years. For those doing the math, that's a year longer than LWN has
been in publication. Exim maintenance was handed off around the time
of his retirement in 2007. Now, he is ready to hand off PCRE2 as well,
if a successor can be found.</p>]]></description>

Andrii Nakryiko led a session at
the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> giving
a look into the APIs for capturing stack traces
using BPF, and how the APIs could be made more useful. BPF programs can capture the
current stack trace of a running process, including the portion in the kernel
during execution of a system call, which can be useful for diagnosing
performance problems, among other things. But there are substantial problems with
the existing API.

Kroah-Hartman</a> and <a

announced that the Linux kernel project had become its own CVE Numbering
Authority (CNA).  Since then, the Linux CNA Team has developed workflows
and mechanisms to help manage the various tasks associated with this
challenge.  There does however, appear to be a lack of understanding among
community members of the processes and rules the team have been working
within.  The principal aim of this article, written by a member of the
Linux kernel CNA team, is to clarify how the team works and how kernel CVE
numbers are assigned.]]></description>

            <title>[$] Static keys for BPF</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/977993/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The kernel has a lot of code paths that are normally disabled: debugging print
statements, tracepoints, etc. To support these efficiently, there
is a common mechanism called
<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/staging/static-keys.html">
static keys</a> that provides a way to enable or disable a
code path at run time, with effectively no overhead for disabled
branches. BPF programs have not been able to take advantage of static keys so far,
because they aren't compiled into the kernel.
Now, it looks like BPF may be getting support for a similar mechanism —
and the design could also provide one of the components needed to support
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_table">
jump tables</a>, another missing feature.
Anton Protopovov presented his plans to add static keys to BPF at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978189/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Software-interrupt handlers (also called "bottom halves") have a long
history in the Linux kernel; for much of that history, developers have
wished that they could go away.  One of their unfortunate characteristics
is that they can add unexpected latency to the execution of unrelated
processes; this problem is felt especially acutely in the
realtime-preemption community.  The solution adopted there has created
problems of its own, though; in response Sebastian Andrzej Siewior is <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240607070427.1379327-1-bigeasy@linutronix.de">proposing</a>
a new locking mechanism for realtime builds of the kernel that may have
benefits for non-realtime users as well.]]></description>

the second release candidate (RC2) of its <a

as MicroOS Desktop GNOME. Aside from the new coat of naming paint,
Aeon breaks ground in a few other ways by dabbling with technologies not found in other openSUSE releases. The goal for Aeon is to provide
automated system updates using snapshots that can be applied
atomically, removing the burden of system maintenance for
"<q>lazy developers</q>" who want to focus on their work rather than desktop
administration. System-tinkerers need not apply.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/977815/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The BPF verifier is a complex program. This has the unfortunate effect of making
it simultaneously more difficult for contributors to work on, and more likely
to harbor unknown bugs. Shung-Hsi Yu had two concrete proposals for how to
simplify the verifier to make it easier to maintain that he presented at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>. Yu proposed changing how the
verifier tracks partially known values and cleaning up the interface to
hide the details of the value-tracker's internal representation.

a summary of "papercut fixes" for GNOME tablet support that are
planned to ship with GNOME 47.</p>


<blockquote class="bq">
<p>If you're an avid tablet user, you may have multiple stylus tools -
but it's also likely that you have multiple tools of the same type
which makes differentiating them in the GUI hard. Which is why they're
highlighted now - if you bring the tool into proximity, the matching
image is highlighted to make it easier to know which stylus you're
about to configure. Oh, and in the process we added a new SVG for AES
styli too to make the picture look more like the actual physical
tool. The &lt;blink&gt; tag may no longer be cool but at least we can disco
our way through the stylus configuration now. </p>

            <title>Not all &quot;open source&quot; AI models are actually open (Nature)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979609/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Nature <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02012-5">looks
at a recent paper</a> on the openness of "open-source" language 
models.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	It is not yet clear how many of these models will fit the EU's
	definition of open source. Under the act, this would refer to
	models that are released under a "free and open" licence that, for
	example, allows users to modify a model but says nothing about
	access to training data. Refining this definition will probably
	form "a single pressure point that will be targeted by corporate
	lobbies and big companies", the paper says.

            <title>Min: sched_ext: scheduler architecture and interfaces</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979532/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Changwoo Min has posted <a
href="https://blogs.igalia.com/changwoo/sched-ext-scheduler-architecture-and-interfaces-part-2/">an
introduction to writing custom schedulers</a> with sched_ext.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	In a particular situation, when each scheduling policy needs its
	specific action, the core kernel scheduler calls an operation
	defined in <tt>struct sched_class</tt>. For example, when the core
	kernel scheduler needs to select a task to be scheduled, it calls
	the <tt>sched_class.pick_next_task(rq)</tt> callback of a concrete
	scheduling policy. When a task becomes runnable, the core kernel
	scheduler calls <tt>sched_class.enqueue(rq, p, flags)</tt> so the
	concrete scheduling policy enqueues task <tt>p</tt> to run queue
	<tt>rq</tt>. When a task's runtime state needs to be updated, the
	core kernel scheduler calls <tt>sched_class.update_curr(rq)</tt>.

29.4</a> of the Emacs editor has been released.  This is "<q>an emergency

the editor to execute arbitrary Org-mode code.  Anybody who runs Emacs on
untrusted files — including those using Gnus or one of the Emacs mail modes
— should be looking to update.  For those who cannot update, a pair of
messages from <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/87h6djh2dv.fsf@hope.eyrie.org">Russ

investigates how to disable the Org-mode evaluation, a task that is
seemingly more complicated than it should be.]]></description>
