            <title>Darktable 4.8.0 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979666/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a
href="https://www.darktable.org/2024/06/darktable-4.8.0-released/">Version
4.8.0</a> of the <a href="https://www.darktable.org/">darktable</a>
photo editor has been released.  Changes include performance
improvements for large collections, addition of more EXIF fields in
the image information module, and two new modules for image
composition: Enlarge Canvas and Overlay. Enlarge Canvas allows adding
areas to an image, while Overlay allows adding new content by
overlaying pixels from the current image or another image. LWN last
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/881853/">looked at darktable</a> in
2022. Users are "<q>strongly advised</q>" to make a backup of their
configuration and library before upgrading, as they will not be
compatible with darktable 4.6.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979609/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Nature <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02012-5">looks
at a recent paper</a> on the openness of "open-source" language 
models.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	It is not yet clear how many of these models will fit the EU's
	definition of open source. Under the act, this would refer to
	models that are released under a "free and open" licence that, for
	example, allows users to modify a model but says nothing about
	access to training data. Refining this definition will probably
	form "a single pressure point that will be targeted by corporate
	lobbies and big companies", the paper says.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979532/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Changwoo Min has posted <a
href="https://blogs.igalia.com/changwoo/sched-ext-scheduler-architecture-and-interfaces-part-2/">an
introduction to writing custom schedulers</a> with sched_ext.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	In a particular situation, when each scheduling policy needs its
	specific action, the core kernel scheduler calls an operation
	defined in <tt>struct sched_class</tt>. For example, when the core
	kernel scheduler needs to select a task to be scheduled, it calls
	the <tt>sched_class.pick_next_task(rq)</tt> callback of a concrete
	scheduling policy. When a task becomes runnable, the core kernel
	scheduler calls <tt>sched_class.enqueue(rq, p, flags)</tt> so the
	concrete scheduling policy enqueues task <tt>p</tt> to run queue
	<tt>rq</tt>. When a task's runtime state needs to be updated, the
	core kernel scheduler calls <tt>sched_class.update_curr(rq)</tt>.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/977762/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>CentOS Linux&nbsp;7 was <a
href="https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2014-July/020393.html">first
released</a> in July&nbsp;2014, and is due to go end-of-life (EOL) on June&nbsp;30.
By now, anyone who pays attention to such things is aware that Red Hat <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/839257/">pulled the plug</a> on
CentOS&nbsp;Linux in late&nbsp;2020 to be replaced by CentOS Stream
instead. CentOS&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;8
support was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/862832/">wound
down</a> at the end of 2021 rather than in 2029 as originally stated.
CentOS Linux&nbsp;7 was allowed to serve out its
full lifespan&mdash;but that EOL is approaching rapidly and
there's no direct upgrade path. Users and organizations looking for a lifeline might want to consider
AlmaLinux's <a href="https://wiki.almalinux.org/elevate/">ELevate</a>
utility, which allows CentOS users to migrate to alternate enterprise
Linux (EL) operating systems.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978010/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958438/"><tt>mseal()</tt> system call</a> allows a
process to prevent any future changes to portions of its address space
(thus "sealing" them); it was patterned after the <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/915640/"><tt>mimmutable()</tt> system call</a> in OpenBSD.
<tt>mseal()</tt> generated a lot of discussion, but it was finally merged
for the upcoming 6.10 kernel release.  While <tt>mseal()</tt> was initially
aimed at securing the Chrome browser, the hope was that it would be useful
elsewhere; as a step toward realizing that hope, Adhemerval Zanella has
posted <a

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/977394/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
BPF is in a unique position in terms of security. It runs in a privileged
context, within the kernel, and can have access to many sensitive details of the
kernel's operation. At the same time, unlike kernel modules, BPF programs aren't signed.
Additionally, the mechanisms behind BPF present challenges to implementing
signing or other security features. Three nearly back-to-back sessions at the
2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>
addressed some of the potential security problems.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/977486/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[VFS maintainer Christian Brauner led a discussion about the possibility of
selectively dropping the contents of the page cache for a filesystem in a
session at the
2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  As he described in his
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240116-tagelang-zugnummer-349edd1b5792%40brauner/">topic
proposal</a>, the use case that started him down this path comes from
GNOME, which wants to be able to safely suspend access to an encrypted home
directory.  While it is known to kernel
developers, it is surprising to others that reads from encrypted
filesystems that have been suspended will succeed if the data to be read
still exists in the 
page cache.]]></description>

networking devices; it is useful for the configuration of firewalls and

on June&nbsp;3 that he was "forking" Ladybird as a separate project and stepping away from
SerenityOS to focus his attention on the browser completely. Ladybird
is not ready to replace Firefox or Chrome for regular use, but it is showing
great promise.</p>]]></description>

            <title>[$] Modernizing BPF for the next 10 years</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/977013/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
BPF was first
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/599755/">
generalized beyond packet filtering</a> more than a decade ago. In that time, it
has changed a lot, becoming much more capable.
Alexei Starovoitov kicked off the second day of the BPF track at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> by leading a session
discussing which changes to BPF are going to come in the next ten years as it
continues evolving. He proposed several ideas, including expanding the number of
registers available to BPF programs, dynamic deadlock detection, and relaxing
some existing limits of the verifier.

            <title>[$] A generic ring buffer for the kernel</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/976836/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The kernel's user-space ABI does not lack for ring buffers; they have been
defined for subsystems like <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/6.6/bpf/ringbuf.html">BPF</a>, <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/776703/">io_uring</a>, <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/userspace-api/perf_ring_buffer.html">perf</a>,
and <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/trace/ring-buffer-map.html">tracing</a>, for
example.  Naturally, each of those ring buffers is unique, with no common
interface between them.  The natural response to this ABI proliferation is,
of course, to add yet another ring buffer as the generic option; that is
the intent of <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20240603003306.2030491-1-kent.overstreet@linux.dev">this
patch series</a> from Kent Overstreet adding a new set of system calls for
ring buffers.]]></description>

1.28</a> of the <a href="https://mate-desktop.org/">MATE Desktop</a>
has been released.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
MATE 1.28 has made significant strides in updating the codebase,
including the removal of deprecated libraries and ensuring
compatibility with the latest GTK versions. One of the most notable
improvements is the enhanced support for Wayland, bringing us closer
to a fully native MATE-Wayland experience. Several components have
been updated to work seamlessly with Wayland, ensuring a more
integrated and responsive desktop environment.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978939/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Version 1.11.0 of Libgcrypt, a general-purpose library of
cryptographic building blocks, has been released by the <a
href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> project:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
This release starts a new stable branch of Libgcrypt with full API and
ABI compatibility to the 1.10 series.  Over the last years Jussi
