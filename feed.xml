            <title>[$] Programming in Unison</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978955/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/">
Unison</a> is a
MIT-licensed programming language, in development since 2013, that
explores the ramifications of making code immutable and stored in a database,
instead of a set of text files.
Unison supports a greatly simplified model for distributed
programming â€” one that describes the configuration of and communication between
programs in the same language as the programs themselves. Along the way, it
introduces a new approach to interfacing with programming languages, which is tailored to
its design.

DevConf.cz</a> in Brno, Czech Republic on June&nbsp;14 about <a

(bootc). The talk, which was streamed to YouTube for those of us who
didn't attend DevConf.cz in person, provided a solid overview of bootc
and the problems it is intended to solve. The idea behind bootc is to
make creating operating-system images just as easy as creating
application-container images while using the same tools.</p>]]></description>

goal of the project is to lower the barrier to entry of using FreeBSD
on a desktop or laptop system, and it largely succeeds at this. While it has a few rough edges
that make it hard to recommend for the average desktop user, it is
a fine choice for users who want a desktop with FreeBSD underpinnings

            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/532593/">User namespaces</a> in Linux create an
environment in which all privileges are granted, but their effect is
contained within the namespace; they have become an important tool for the
implementation of containers.  They have also become a significant source
of worries for people who do not like the increased attack surface they
create for the kernel.  Various attempts have been made to restrict that
attack surface over the years; the latest is <a

about his work on
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/335942/">
Poke-a-hole</a> (pahole),
a program that has expanded greatly over the years, but which was relevant to the
BPF track because it produces BPF Type Format (BTF) information from DWARF
debugging information. He covered some small changes to the program, and then
went into detail about the new support for data-type profiling. His

several examples.

that manual steps are required to continue receiving updates. Jorge
Castro wrote:</p>


<blockquote class="bq">
<p>If you use Bazzite, Bluefin, Aurora, or any other Universal Blue

back</a> at 40 years of the X Window System:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	A major reason for Sun's early success was that they in effect
	open-sourced the Network File System. X11 was open source under the
	MIT license. I, and some of the other Sun engineers, understood
	that NeWS could not displace X11 as the Unix standard window system
	without being equally open source. But Sun's management looked at
	NeWS and saw superior technology, an extension of the PostScript
	that Adobe was selling, and couldn't bring themselves to give it
	away.

Zurich.  Development of Scientific Linux stopped with SL7, with the labs
switching to CentOS thereafter, but the SL7 release was supported through
to the bitter end.  Thanks are due to all who built and supported
Scientific Linux; you provided a useful and stable platform for many years.]]></description>

The Free Software Foundation Europe has
<a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2024/news-20240627-01.en.html">
submitted</a> a joint position to the European Commission (EC), claiming that Apple
has failed to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). This is the law
that requires Apple to support alternative application stores on the devices it
makes.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Apple's unfair behaviour against Free Software highlights the critical need to
monitor the implementation of the DMA. The FSFE collaborated with F-Droid, the
AppFair project, and other interoperability experts to scrutinize Apple's DMA
compliance, and it's impact on Free Software. Since then, we coordinated several
expert workshops with stakeholders,
<a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2024/news-20240318-02.en.html">
discussed with regulators in FOSDEM</a>, had
<a href="https://fsfe.org/news/nl/nl-202406.en.html#interoperability-apple">

            <title>Highlights from the FreeBSD Developer Summit</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979935/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The FreeBSD Foundation has published
<a
href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/highlights-from-the-freebsd-developer-summit-2024-innovations-and-future-directions/">a
set of reports</a> from the <a
href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/news-and-events/event-calendar/may-2024-freebsd-developer-summit/">May
2024 FreeBSD Developer Summit</a> held in Ottawa, Canada. The topics
include FreeBSD Core Team updates, FreeBSD 15 release planning,
Integration with Rust, and <a
href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/2024-freebsd-developer-summit-oci-containers-on-freebsd/">OCI
containers on FreeBSD</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Doug Rabson began by providing an overview of the current state of
FreeBSD support for OCI containers, noting that while FreeBSD has long
supported containers through its jail and vnet features, the ecosystem
around OCI containers requires further development. "FreeBSD has been
able to do containers for a long time, but we need to align better
with OCI standards to make our containers more compatible and easier
to use," Rabson remarkedâ€‹â€‹.

            <title>Free Software Foundation adds three board members</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979918/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has <a
href="https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-adds-3-highly-qualified-board-members">announced</a>
the addition of three new members to its board: John Gilmore,
Christina Haralanova, and Maria Chiara Pievatolo. This is part of FSF
governance changes <a
href="https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board/board/board-process-graph">announced</a>
in January 2023. The next step is a review of current board
members:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
These three new members of the FSF's board of directors are the first
to be appointed since 2020, when Odile BÃ©nassy joined. Given the
importance of the FSF to the free software movement, and the
importance of its board to ensure preservation of the software freedom
definition, the board has not taken its task lightly. Next, the FSF
will evaluate current board members with the FSF's associate members
in August, after which the <a
href="https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-board-frequently-asked-questions-faq#BoardvsVoting">voting
members</a> will review the feedback
received and decide if each current board member should remain.
</blockquote>

<p>More information on the process, and a short biography of each new
board member, is available in the full announcement.</p>]]></description>
