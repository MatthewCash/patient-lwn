            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://radicle.xyz/2024/09/10/radicle-1.0.html">Version 1.0</a>
of the Radicle development platform has been released.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Radicle 1.0 represents the culmination of years of experimentation
	and hard work from our team and community, where we set out to
	ensure that free and open source software ecosystems can flourish
	without having to rely on the whims of Big Tech. We designed
	Radicle with a first-principles approach, as a natural extension to
	Git, expanding it to work in a collaborative, local-first,
	peer-to-peer setting.

            <title>The realtime preemption end game â€” for real this time</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/989212/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Work on realtime preemption for the Linux kernel <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/106010/">got its start</a> almost exactly 20&nbsp;years ago
(though it had its roots in earlier work, of course).  It is fair to say
that finishing that job has taken a bit longer than anybody involved would
have expected.  Now, though, Sebastian Andrzej Siewior has <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240906111841.562402-1-bigeasy@linutronix.de">posted a brief
patch series</a> making it possible to enable realtime preemption in the
mainline kernel on three architectures.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	With the printk bits merged, PREEMPT_RT could be enabled on X86,
	ARM64 and Risc-V. These three architectures merged required changes
	over the years leaving me in a position where I have no essential
	changes in the queue that would affect them.

<p>
Congratulations are due to the many developers who have worked on this
project for the last two decades.]]></description>
