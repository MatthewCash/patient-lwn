            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/984313/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The desire for the ability to checkpoint a process — to record its state in
a form that can be restarted at a future time — on Linux is almost as old as
Linux itself.  See, for example, <a
href="https://lwn.net/1998/0528/a/checkpoint.html">this announcement</a> of a checkpoint
project that appeared in LWN in 1998.  While working solutions exist, they
can be somewhat fragile and difficult to use; it is not surprising that
some people are interested in finding a better alternative.  A current
effort goes by the name CRIB,
for Checkpoint/Restore in (naturally) BPF.  It is far from clear that CRIB
will replace the existing solutions, but it is an interesting look at a
different way of solving the problem.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/984556/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[There are lots of places in the kernel where an <tt>EINVAL</tt> can be
returned to user space, but it is often unclear what the actual underlying
problem is because the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html"><tt>errno</tt></a>
error codes are too generic.  That is the problem that Miklos Szeredi
wanted to discuss in a filesystem session that he led remotely at the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  He would like to help
those who are trying to debug problems trace where in the kernel a
particular error code is being generated.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983714/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[David Howells wanted to discuss changing the way filesystem code handles
the ability to interrupt or kill operations, in order to fix some
longstanding problems with network 
(and other) filesystems, in a session at
the 2024 <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.   As noted in
his <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/2701318.1706863882%40warthog.procyon.org.uk/">session
proposal</a>, some filesystems may be expecting to not be interruptible,
but are calling code can take locks and mutexes that are interruptible (or
killable), which are effectively
changing the state of the task incorrectly.
He would like to find a solution for that problem.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/BUSL-1.1.html">Business
Source License</a> (BUSL) is a source-available license that "converts"
to an open-source license after a period of time. In theory, this
means that a few years after a version of a product is released under
the BUSL, it becomes open source and is fair game for Linux
distributions to package along with regular open-source projects. In
practice, the license throws a few curveballs that require special
consideration and caution, as the Fedora Project recently discussed.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983843/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
There is ongoing discussion about the ethics and effectiveness of
telemetry following some recent LWN articles that touched on
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/982610/">
Thunderbird's use of opt-out
telemetry</a> and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/980598/">planned metrics in Fedora</a>. The
<a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/">
Internet Security Research Group</a> (ISRG), the nonprofit behind
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">
Let's Encrypt</a>, has a potential solution to the problem of how to collect and
aggregate telemetry without violating users' privacy. The scheme is based on a
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ppm-dap/">draft
protocol</a> being standardized with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),
and has an
<a href="https://github.com/divviup/libprio-rs">open-source implementation</a>
available.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983965/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Like many projects written in C, the kernel makes extensive use of the C
preprocessor; indeed, the kernel's use is rather more extensive than most.
The preprocessor famously has a number of sharp edges associated with it.
One might not normally think of increased compilation time as one of them,
though.  It turns out that some changes to a couple of conceptually simple
preprocessor macros — <tt>min()</tt> and <tt>max()</tt> — led to some truly
pathological, but hidden, behavior where those macros were used.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/984984/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Researchers from Graz University of Technology have
<a href="https://www.stefangast.eu/papers/slubstick.pdf">published</a> details of a new attack
on the Linux kernel called SLUBstack. The attack uses timing information to turn an ability to trigger use-after-free or double-free bugs into the ability to overwrite page tables, and thence into the ability to read and write arbitrary areas of memory. The good news is that this attack does require an existing bug to be usable; the bad news is that the kernel regularly sees bugs of this kind.

Additionally, we consider the presence of a heap vulnerability

These mechanisms include features such as WˆX, KASLR,
SMAP, and kCFI. We do not assume any microarchitectural 
vulnerabilities, e.g., transient execution, fault
injection, or hardware side channels.

            <title>0.0.0.0 Day: Exploiting Localhost APIs From the Browser (Oligo Security)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/984838/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Oligo Security blog <a
href="https://www.oligo.security/blog/0-0-0-0-day-exploiting-localhost-apis-from-the-browser">discloses</a>
a web-browser vulnerability that has been named "0.0.0.0 day".  In short,
browsers will allow JavaScript code to open connections to the all-zeroes
IPv4 address; the result is that any port that is open on the local host
can be accessed by a remote site.  "<q>When services use localhost, they
assume a constrained environment. This assumption, which can (as in the
case of this vulnerability) be faulty, results in insecure server
implementations.</q>"]]></description>
