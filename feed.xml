            <title>Security proof for Linux&apos;s random number generator</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/990596/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Four researchers have <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1421.pdf">published</a> a formal proof that Linux's new deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) is secure in a particular sense â€” specifically, that the number of queries that would need to be made to it to uncover its internal state depends on the quality of the entropy it can collect from different sources. As long as it can gather enough entropy, it produces secure random numbers.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Since the significant structural changes in Linux 4 and Linux 5.17, there has
been no research on the provable security of Linux-DRBG. For the first time (to
the best of our knowledge), we formally model the Linux-DRBG in Linux 6.4.8
and prove its security in the seedless robustness model
</blockquote>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://valkey.io/blog/valkey-8-ga/">Version 8.0.0</a> of
the <a href="https://valkey.io">Valkey</a> open-source in-memory data
store is now available. This is the first major release of Valkey
since the project <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/966631/">forked</a> from <a
href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> in March of this year:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
While this is a major version, Valkey takes command set compatibility
seriously: Valkey 8.0.0 makes no backwards incompatible changes to the
existing command syntax or their responses. Your existing tools and
custom software will be able to immediately take advantage of Valkey
8.0.0. Since Valkey 8.0.0 does make some small changes to previously
undefined behaviors, it's wise to <a
href="https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/blob/8.0.0/00-RELEASENOTES">read
the release notes</a>. Additionally, because this version makes changes in how the
software uses threading, you may want to re-evaluate your cluster's
infrastructure to achieve the highest performance.

            <title>Sovereign Tech Fund (STF) to invest in Samba improvements</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/990264/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Germany's <a href="https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/">Sovereign
Tech Fund</a> (STF) has agreed to <a
href="https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/tech/samba">invest â‚¬688,800</a>
to improve the security, stability, and functionality of <a
href="https://www.samba.org/">Samba</a>. The investment will take
place over three years and will be managed by <a href="https://samba.plus/about-sernet">SerNet</a>, a company that
employs several Samba core developers and offers support for
Samba. According to its <a
href="https://samba.plus/blog/detail/sernet-secures-funding-for-samba-project-from-sovereign-tech-fund">announcement</a>,
work has already begun and is expected to complete in 2026:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
The project's focus is on areas like transparent failover, SMB3 UNIX
extensions, and modern security protocols such as SMB over QUIC. These
improvements are designed to ensure that Samba remains a robust and
secure solution for organizations that rely on a sovereign IT
infrastructure that is as independent as possible of proprietary
software regimes, but including optimal interoperability.

            <description><![CDATA[Much of the early Rust code for the kernel has taken the form of
reimplementations of existing drivers as a proof of concept.  One project,
though, is entirely new: the driver for Apple GPUs written by Asahi Lina.
This driver has shipped with <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi
Linux</a> for some time and, by many accounts, is stable, usable, and a
shining example of how Rust can be used in a complex kernel subsystem.
That driver remains outside of the mainline kernel, though, and merging
currently looks like a distant prospect.  The reasons for that state of
affairs highlight some of the difficulties inherent in integrating a new
language (and its associated development style) into the Linux kernel.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the joys of writing about technology is the opportunity to
cover interesting talks on open&#8209;source and free&#8209;software topics. One
of the pains is creating transcriptions of said talks, or continually
referring back to a recording, to be able to write about
them. <a href="https://github.com/mkiol/dsnote">Speech Note</a> is an
open-source application that uses machine-learning models, running locally, to
translate speech to text and take the pain out of transcription. It
also handles text to speech, and language translations. While not
perfect, its transcriptions are better than one might expect, even when
handling jargon, accents, and less-than-perfect audio.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>At this year's <a href="https://events.gnome.org/event/209/">GUADEC</a> in Denver, Colorado, Behdad Esfahbod and Matthias Clasen
presented a <a href="https://events.gnome.org/event/209/contributions/749/">two-part talk</a> on a topic that's deeply important to desktop
environments: fonts. Esfahbod covered advances in font
technology that are making their way to becoming standards, and Clasen briefly
discussed improvements in GTK text rendering. The talk presented some
fascinating insights into the problems around accurately rendering
writing systems on the desktop, and where font technologies may be
