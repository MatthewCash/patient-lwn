            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The
<a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org/">
Sequoia</a> OpenPGP library has been in development for some time. LWN
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/830902/">covered</a> the library in 2020. Now the project's
command-line interface has
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1002411/">been released</a>. The <tt>sq</tt> tool offers a
promising alternative to the venerable
<a href="https://gnupg.org/">
GNU Privacy Guard</a> (GPG) tool â€” albeit one with a
different interface, set of terminology, and approach to the web of
trust. Several distributions are making increasing use of the tool
behind the scenes.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001224/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The
<a href="https://www.ponylang.io/">Pony</a> programming language is dedicated to
exploring how to make high-performance
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">
actor-based</a> systems. Started in 2014,
the language's most notable feature is probably
<a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.io/reference-capabilities/">
reference capabilities</a>, a system of pointer annotations that gives the developer
fine manual control over how data is shared between actors, while simultaneously
ensuring that Pony programs don't have data races. The language is not likely to
overtake other more popular programming languages, but its ideas could be useful for
other languages or frameworks struggling with concurrent data access.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003059/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The origins of the TCP and UDP network protocols can be traced back a full
50&nbsp;years.  Even though networks and their use have changed radically
since those protocols were designed, they can still be found behind most
networking applications.  Unsurprisingly, these protocols are not optimal
for all situations, so there is ongoing interest in the development of
alternatives.  One such is the <a
href="https://homa-transport.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOMA/overview">Homa
transport protocol</a>, developed by John Ousterhout (of <a
href="https://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl/Tk</a> and <a
href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> fame, among other accomplishments),
which is aimed at data-center applications.  Ousterhout is currently trying
to get <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20241217000626.2958-1-ouster@cs.stanford.edu">a
minimal Homa implementation</a> into the kernel.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Nick Tait
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/14/3">announced</a> on the
oss-security mailing list that
<a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">
rsync</a>, the widely used file transfer program, had a number of serious vulnerabilities.
Users can mitigate all six vulnerabilities by upgrading to
version 3.4.0, which was 
<a href="https://lists.samba.org/archive/rsync-announce/2025/000120.html">
released</a> on January 14. While all users should upgrade, servers that use rsyncd are
especially impacted:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
In the most severe CVE, an attacker only requires
anonymous read access to a rsync server, such as a public mirror, to
execute arbitrary code on the machine the server is running on.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> project has <a
href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/01/the-people-should-own-the-town-square/">announced</a>
that founder Eugen Rochko will be transferring "<q>key Mastodon
ecosystem and platform components (including name and copyrights,
among other assets)</q>" to a new non-profit organization:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Practically Mastodon will remain headquartered in and operate from
Europe primarily. We will continue day-to-day operations through the
Mastodon GmbH for-profit entity, which will become wholly owned by the
new European not-for-profit entity. The Mastodon GmbH entity
automatically became a for-profit as a result of its charitable status
being <a
href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/04/mastodon-forms-new-u.s.-non-profit/#mastodons-non-profit-status-in-germany">stripped
away in Germany</a>. The existing US-based non-profit entity, the
501(c)(3), will continue to function as a fundraising hub.</p>

<p>[...] We are in the process of a phased transition. First we are
establishing a new legal home for Mastodon and transferring ownership
and stewardship. We are taking the time to select the appropriate
jurisdiction and structure in Europe. Then we will determine which
other (subsidiary) legal structures are needed to support operations
and sustainability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rochko has, naturally, also <a

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hans de Goede has <a
href="https://hansdegoede.dreamwidth.org/29233.html">posted an
update</a> about his work to support IPU6 cameras on Fedora and
submitting fixes upstream.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The initial IPU6 camera support landed in Fedora 41 only works on a
limited set of laptops. The reason for this is that with MIPI cameras
every different sensor and glue-chip like IO-expanders needs to be
supported separately.</p>

<p>I have been working on making the camera work on more laptop
models. After receiving and sending many emails and blog post comments
about this I have started filing Fedora bugzilla issues on a per
sensor and/or laptop-model basis to be able to properly keep track of
all the work.</p>

            <title>Paolo Mantegazza RIP</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1004774/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[We have just now received word of <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/xenomai/87ikqnuiqb.fsf@xenomai.org/">the
passing of Paolo Mantegazza</a>, the driving force behind the <a
href="https://www.rtai.org/">Real Time Application Interface</a> project
and a key figure in the development of realtime Linux.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Paolo used to describe himself as a simple practitioner of software
	development, one of whose missions was to contribute a free
	real-time system his students could use, study and improve for
	their research work at the university, welcoming others to
	join. Many Linux users and businesses owe him a lot, because under
	his leadership, the RTAI project has always defended the freedom of
	developers to implement real-time systems, particularly at times
	when it was threatened. His fierce will for RTAI served the Xenomai
	project, as well as others.
</blockquote>
<p>
He will be missed.

            <title>Automattic reduces WordPress contributions</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1004705/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Automattic has <a
href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/">announced</a>
that it is reallocating its resources away from contributing to the
WordPress project as a response to the WP&nbsp;Engine lawsuit:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
As part of this reset, Automattic will match its volunteering pledge
with those made by WP Engine and other players in the ecosystem, or
about 45 hours a week that qualify under the Five For the Future
program as benefitting the entire community and not just a single
company. These hours will likely go towards security and critical
updates.

heads-up on this latest development.]</p>

            <title>Rust 1.84.0 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1004614/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/01/09/Rust-1.84.0.html">Version
1.84.0</a> of the Rust language has been released.  Changes include
improved version selection for dependencies in Cargo, the beginning of the
migration to a new trait solver, and some updated pointer-provenance APIs.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Most of the time, programmers do not need to worry much about
	provenance, and it is very clear how a pointer got
	derived. However, when casting pointers to integers and back, the
	provenance of the resulting pointer is underspecified. With this
	release, Rust is adding a set of APIs that can in many cases
	replace the use of integer-pointer-casts, and therefore avoid the
	ambiguities inherent to such casts. In particular, the pattern of
	using the lowest bits of an aligned pointer to store extra
	information can now be implemented without ever casting a pointer
	to an integer or back. This makes the code easier to reason about,
	easier to analyze for the compiler, and also benefits tools like
	Miri and architectures like CHERI that aim to detect and diagnose
	pointer misuse.

            <description><![CDATA[The Software Freedom Conservancy is <a
href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2025/jan/09/avm-copyleft-lawsuit-resolved-with-install/">reporting</a>
that AVM has released the full source and installation scripts for its
routers in response to a lawsuit, filed by Sebastian Steck, based on Lesser
GNU Public License rights.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Historically, lawsuits have focused on the copyrights licensed
	under GPL (or the GPL and LGPL together). Steck's lawsuit uniquely
	focused exclusively on users' rights under the LGPL. Steck's work
	showed that despite being a "Lesser" license than GPL, LGPLv2.1
	still guarantees users the right to repair, modify and reinstall
	modified versions of the software on their device. There is now no
	doubt that both GPL and LGPL mandate the device owner's ability to
	make changes to the software in the flash memory so those changes
	persist across reboots.
