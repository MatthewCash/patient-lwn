            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/997238/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Programming language polyglots are files that are valid
programs in multiple languages, and do different things in each. While polyglots are normally
nothing more than a curiosity, the
<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html">
Cosmopolitan Libc</a> project has been trying
to put them to a novel use: producing native, multi-platform binaries that
run directly on several operating systems and architectures. There are still
some rough edges with the project's approach, but it is generally possible to
build C programs into a polyglot format with with minimal
tweaking.

            <description><![CDATA[Over the years, there has been steady progress in adding security features to
compilers and other tools to assist with hardening the Linux kernel (and, of course, other

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/996720/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://github.com/bit-team/backintime?tab=readme-ov-file#back-in-time">
Back In Time</a> is a GPL-2.0-licensed backup tool based on
<a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">
rsync</a> and written in Python. It has both graphical and command-line interfaces, and
supports backups to local disks or over SSH.
Back In Time was originally written by
Oprea Dan and released in 2009. The tool has been
through some rough patches over the years, and is currently on its third set of
maintainers. Christian Buhtz, one of the current maintainers, explained to me
how he and his co-maintainers had revived the project, as well as why he thought
Back In Time stood out from all of the existing backup solutions.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/995915/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Fedora Linux, as a rule, handles version upgrades reasonably
well. However, there are times when users may want to do a fresh
installation rather than an upgrade <em>but</em> preserve existing
users and data under <tt>/home</tt>. This is a scenario that the
Fedora installer, currently, does not address. Users can maintain a
separate <tt>/home</tt> partition, of course, but the installer does
not incorporate existing users into the new install&mdash;that is an
exercise left to the user to handle. One solution might be to use <a
href="https://systemd.io/HOME_DIRECTORY/">systemd-homed</a>, a systemd
service for managing users and home directories. However, a discussion
proposing the use systemd-homed as part of Fedora installation
uncovered some hurdles, such as trying to blend its approach to
managing users with tools that centralize user management.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Flexible arrays — arrays that are declared as the final member of a
structure and which have a size determined at run time — have long drawn
the attention of developers seeking to harden the kernel against
buffer-overflow vulnerabilities.  These arrays have reliably been a source
of bugs, so anything that can be done to ensure that operations on them
stay within bounds is a welcome improvement.  While many improvements,
including the recent <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/936728/">counted-by work</a>, have
been made, one of the most difficult cases remains.  Now, however,
developers who are interested in using recent compiler bounds-checking

            <title>Plans for CHICKEN 6</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998856/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://www.call-cc.org/">
CHICKEN Scheme</a>, a portable Scheme compiler, is gearing up for its next major release. Maintainer Felix Winkelmann has
shared
<a href="https://www.more-magic.net/posts/chicken-6.html">
an article</a> about what changes to expect in version 6 of the language, including better Unicode support and support for the
<a href="https://r7rs.org/">
R7RS</a> Scheme standard.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Every major release is a chance of fixing long-standing problems with the codebase and address bad design decisions. CHICKEN is now nearly 25 years old and we had many major overhauls of the system. Sometimes these caused a lot of pain, but still we always try to improve things and hopefully make it more enjoyable and practical for our users. There are places in the code that are messy, too complex, or that require cleanup or rewrite, always sitting there waiting to be addressed. On the other hand CHICKEN has been relatively stable compared to many other language implementations and has a priceless community of users that help us improving it. Our users never stop reminding us of what could be better, where the shortcomings are, where things are hard to use or inefficient.

	Well, I'm very proud to say those two issues are now solved.

            <title>A new package manager for OpenWrt</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998446/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The OpenWrt router-oriented distribution has long used its own <tt>opk</tt>
package manager.  The project has just <a
href="https://forum.openwrt.org/t/major-change-notice-new-package-manager/215682">announced</a>,
though, that future releases will use the <a
href="https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Working/apk.html"><tt>apk</tt>
package manager from Alpine Linux</a> instead.  "<q>This new package
manager offers a number of advantages over the older opkg system and is a
significant milestone in the development of the OpenWrt platform. The older
opkg package manager has been deprecated and is no longer part of
OpenWrt.</q>" There is some more information on <a

            <title>PyPI now supports digital attestations</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998215/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Python Package Index (PyPI) has <a
href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-11-14-pypi-now-supports-digital-attestations/">announced</a>
that it has finalized support for <a
href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0740/">PEP 740</a> ("Index support
for digital attestations"). <a
href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a>, which performed
much of the development work for the implementation, has an <a
href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/11/14/attestations-a-new-generation-of-signatures-on-pypi/">in-depth
blog post</a> about the work and its adoption, as well as what is left
undone:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>One thing is notably missing from all of this work:
<strong>downstream verification</strong>. [...]</p>

<p>This isn't an acceptable end state (cryptographic attestations have
defensive properties only insofar as they're <strong><em>actually
verified</em></strong>), so we're looking into ways to bring
verification to individual installing clients. In particular, we're
currently working on a <a
href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12766">plugin architecture
for <tt>pip</tt></a> that will enable users to <a
href="https://github.com/trailofbits/pip-plugin-pep740">load
verification logic</a> directly into their <tt>pip install</tt>
flows.</p>
