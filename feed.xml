            <description><![CDATA[The advent of the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/849538/">folio</a> structure to
describe groups of pages has been one of the most fundamental
transformations within the kernel in recent years.  Since the folio
transition affects many subsystems, it is fitting that the subject was
covered at the beginning of the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> in a joint session of the
storage, filesystem, and memory-management tracks.  Matthew Wilcox used the
session to review the work that has been done in this area and to discuss
what comes next.]]></description>

            <title>[$] Portable LLMs with llamafile</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/971195/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Large language models (LLMs) have been the subject of much discussion and
scrutiny recently. Of particular interest to open-source enthusiasts are the
problems with running LLMs on one's own hardware — especially when doing so
requires NVIDIA's proprietary CUDA toolkit, which remains unavailable in many
environments.
Mozilla has developed
<a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile">llamafile</a> as a
potential solution to these problems. Llamafile can compile LLM weights
into portable, native executables for easy integration, archival, or
distribution. These executables can take advantage of supported GPUs when
present, but do not require them.

this is a major release containing a lot of changes and new features.  Our
merge-window summaries (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/965141/">part&nbsp;1</a>, <a

the development cycle is complete, the time has come to look at where all
that work came from — and to introduce a new and experimental LWN feature
for readers interested in this kind of information.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/971817/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Maintainers of open-source projects sometimes have disagreements with
contributors over how contributions are reviewed, modified, merged, and
credited. A written policy describing how contributions are handled can
help maintainers set reasonable expectations for potential contributors.
In turn, that can make the maintainer's job easier because it can help
reduce a source of friction in the project.  A guide to help create this
kind of policy for a project has recently been developed.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In April, the Gentoo Linux project <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/970072/">banned</a> the use of
generative AI/ML tools due to copyright, ethical, and quality
concerns. This means contributors cannot use tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to
creating content for the distribution such as code, documentation,
bug reports, forum posts. A proposal for Debian to adopt a similar
policy revealed a distinct lack of love for those kinds of tools,
though it would also seem few contributors support
banning them outright. </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The extensible scheduler class (or "sched_ext") is a comprehensive
framework that enables the implementation of CPU schedulers as a set of BPF
programs that can be loaded at run time.  Despite having attracted a fair
amount of interest from the development community, sched_ext has run into
considerable opposition and seems far from acceptance into the mainline.

be.]]></description>

<blockquote class="bq">
[It] is dedicated to guiding the technical direction of the
AlmaLinux distribution on a day-to-day basis within the guidelines set
forth by the board, ensuring its robustness, reliability,
sustainability, and relevance in the open-source ecosystem. ALESCo
will work collaboratively with, and oversee relevant technical-focused
Special Interest Groups (SIGs) to achieve these goals. It is "air
traffic control" for engineering matters.

<p>The initial members of ALESCo appointed by the AlmaLinux OS
Foundation board are Andrew Lukoshko, Ben Thomas, Cody Robertson,
Elkhan Mammadli, Jonathan Wright, and Neal Gompa. The <a

the new io_uring features</a> that will be a part of the 6.10 kernel
release.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Bundles are multiple buffers used in a single operation. On the
	receive side, this means a single receive may utilize multiple
	buffers, reducing the roundtrip through the networking stack from N
	per N buffers to just a single one. On the send side, this also
	enables better handling of how an application deals with sends from
	a socket, eliminating the need to serialize sends on a single
	socket. Bundles work with provided buffers, hence this feature also
	adds support for provided buffers for send operations.

            <title>White paper: Vendor Kernels, Bugs and Stability</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/973996/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Ronnie Sahlberg, Jonathan Maple, and Jeremy Allison of CiQ have published
<a href="https://ciq.com/whitepaper/vendor-kernels-bugs-stability/">a white
paper</a> looking at the security-relevant bug fixes applied (or <i>not</i>
applied) to the RHEL&nbsp;8.x kernel over time.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	This means that over time, the security of the RHEL kernels get
	worse and worse as more issues are discovered in the upstream code
	and are potentially exploitable but fewer and fewer of the fixes
	for these known bugs are back-ported into RHEL kernels.
<P>
	After reaching RHEL 8.7, the theory is that the kernel has been
	stabilized, with a corresponding improvement in security. However
	we still have an influx of newly discovered bugs in the upstream
	kernel affecting RHEL 8.7 that are not addressed. Each minor
	version of upstream is released on an approximately quarterly basis
	and we can see that the influx of new bugs that are unaddressed in
	RHEL is growing. The number of known issues in these kernels
	increases by approximately 250 new bugs per quarter or more.

<blockquote class="bq">
 We follow a "fun driven development" paradigm: for the most part,
 contributors and maintainers work on things that are personally
 interesting to them. Because of this, it can be difficult to predict
 what will happen in future releases. If there is a feature you want
 to see implemented, the best way to do it is to take a crack at it
 yourself: many of the features mentioned in this very blog post were
 contributed by users that are not part of the "core" maintenance
 team!
