            <description><![CDATA[<p>In July, Let's Encrypt <a

support "<q>as soon as possible</q>" for the <a

Certificate Status Protocol</a> (OCSP) in favor of <a

Revocation Lists</a> (CRLs) due to privacy concerns. The organization
has now <a
href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/05/ending-ocsp/">announced</a>
that it has set a timeline, and will be turning off its OCSP
responders on August&nbsp;6, 2025. There is additional action required
for Let's Encrypt users who use the OSCP Must Staple Extension:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>As of January 30, 2025, issuance requests that include the OCSP
Must Staple extension will fail, unless the requesting account has
previously issued a certificate containing the OCSP Must Staple
extension.</p>

<p>As of May 7, all issuance requests that include the OCSP Must
Staple extension will fail, including renewals. Please change your
ACME client configuration to not request the extension.</p>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1000871/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Greg Kroah-Hartman has released the <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1000872/">6.12.2</a>, <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1000873/">6.11.11</a>, and <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1000874/">4.19.325</a> stable kernels.  Note that both
6.11.11 and 4.19.325 are the last kernels in those series, "<q>please move
off to a newer kernel version</q>".  In the 4.19.325 release notice, he has
a rather longer-than-usual message, including:

<blockquote class="bq">
As a "fun" proof that this one is finished (and that any company saying
they care about it really should have their statements validated with
facts), I looked at the "unfixed" CVEs from this kernel release.
Currently it is a list 983 CVEs long, too long to list here.
<p>
You can verify it yourself by cloning the vulns.git repo at
git.kernel.org and running:
<pre>
	./scripts/strak v4.19.325
</pre>
Note, this does NOT count the hardware CVEs which kernel.org does not
track, and many are sill unfixed in this kernel branch.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998153/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The most common piece of advice given to users who ask about
running their own mail server is <em><a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/987566/">don't</a></em>. Setting up
and securing a mail server in&nbsp;2024 is not for the faint of heart, nor
for anyone without copious spare time. Spammers want to flood inboxes
with ads for questionable supplements, attackers want to abuse servers
to send spam (or worse), and getting the big providers to accept mail
from small servers is a constant uphill battle. Michael W. Lucas,
however, encourages users to thumb their nose at the "<q>Email
Empire</q>", and declare email independence. His self-published book,
<em><a href="https://mwl.io/nonfiction/tools#ryoms">Run Your Own Mail
Server</a></em>, provides a manual (and manifesto) for users who are
interested in the challenge.</p>]]></description>

perspective, but 6.12 includes a long list of significant new features.
The time has come to look at where those changes came from, and to look at
the year-long LTS cycle as well.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998221/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The kernel's loadable-module facility allows code to be loaded into (and
sometimes removed from) a running kernel.  Among other things, loadable
modules make it possible to run a kernel with only the subsystems needed
for the system's hardware and workload.  Loadable modules can also make it
easy for out-of-tree code to access parts of the kernel that developers
would prefer to keep private; this has led to <a
href="https://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/#Modules-Exported_symbols">many discussions</a> in the
past.  The topic has returned to the kernel's mailing lists with two
different patch sets aimed at further tightening the restrictions applied
to loadable modules.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Fedora Project is set to welcome a second desktop edition to its
lineup after months (or years, depending when one starts the clock)
of discussions. The project recently decided to allow a new working group to
move forward with a KDE&nbsp;Plasma&nbsp;Desktop edition that will sit
alongside the existing GNOME-based Fedora&nbsp;Workstation
edition. This puts KDE on a more equal footing within the project,
which, it is hoped, will bring more contributors and users interested
in KDE to adopt Fedora as their Linux distribution of choice.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/997563/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Direct memory access (DMA) I/O is simple in concept: a peripheral device
moves data directly to or from memory while the CPU is busy doing other
things.  As is so often the case, DMA is rather more complicated in
practice, and the kernel has developed a complicated internal API to
support it.  It turns out that the DMA API, as it exists now, can affect
the performance of some high-bandwidth devices.  In an effort to address
that problem, Leon Romanovsky is making the API even more complex with <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/cover.1731244445.git.leon@kernel.org">this patch series</a>
adding a new two-step mapping API.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Linus Walleij <a
href="https://people.kernel.org/linusw/new-arm32-security-features-in-v6-10">writes
about a pair of security features for 32-bit Arm systems</a>; these landed
in 6.10, but, he says, have now stabilized to the point that distributors
may want to enable them.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	PAN is an abbreviation for the somewhat grammatically incorrect
	Privileged Access Never. [...]
<p>
	For modern ARM32 systems with large memories configured to use LPAE
	nothing like PAN was available: this version of the MMU simply did
	not implement a PAN option.
<p>
	As of the patch originally developed by Catalin Marinas, we deploy
	a scheme that will use the fact that LPAE has two separate
	translation table base registers (TTBR:s): one for userspace
	(TTBR0) and one for kernelspace (TTBR1).

NixOS is already known as <a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/newest">the most up to date distribution</a> while also being <a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/total">the distribution with the most packages</a>. This release saw <b>8141&nbsp;new</b> packages and <b>20975&nbsp;updated</b> packages in Nixpkgs. We also <b>removed&nbsp;3970</b> packages in an effort to keep the package set maintainable and secure.

            <title>A kernel code of conduct enforcement action</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/999197/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The <a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/tab/start">Linux Foundation Technical
Advisory Board</a> (TAB) has <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/6740fc3aabec0_5eb129497@dwillia2-xfh.jf.intel.com.notmuch/">decided</a> to "<q>restrict Kent Overstreet's
participation in the kernel development process during the Linux 6.13
kernel development cycle</q>" based on a recommendation from the <a
href="https://kernel.org/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct
committee</a>.  In particular, the scope of the restriction will be to "<q>decline all pull
requests from Kent Overstreet</q>" during the development cycle.
Overstreet is the creator and maintainer of the <a
href="https://bcachefs.org/">bcachefs</a> filesystem.

<p>
This
action stems from a <a 
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/citv2v6f33hoidq75xd2spaqxf7nl5wbmmzma4wgmrwpoqidhj@k453tmq7vdrk/">message</a>
Overstreet posted back in early September that was abusive toward another
kernel developer; there is a fair amount of back-and-forth about the
incident and the committee's attempts to extract a public apology from
Overstreet in that thread.  Overstreet has published a <a

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1000097/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Earlier today, one of our subscribers, anselm, posted the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1000000/">one millionth</a> item in our database during a discussion in the comments about the GPL. One million articles and comments is a big milestone â€” one representing twenty two years of work by both the editors of LWN and the community. I think reaching this milestone on Thanksgiving is a lovely coincidental reminder of how far LWN has come, and how that wouldn't have been possible without your support. So thank you for reading.
