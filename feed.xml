            <title>A new kernel-version policy for Ubuntu</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/985043/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Canonical Kernel Team has <a
href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/kernel-version-selection-for-ubuntu-releases/47007">announced</a>
a new policy regarding the version of the kernel that will ship with each
Ubuntu release; the result will generally be the shipping of newer
releases.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	To provide users with the absolute latest in features and hardware
	support, Ubuntu will now ship the absolute latest available version
	of the upstream Linux kernel at the specified Ubuntu release freeze
	date, even if upstream is still in Release Candidate (RC) status.
</blockquote>
<p>
The post goes on to acknowledge that "<q>there are issues with this
approach</q>"; there are a lot of policy details that will apply depending
on just how raw the shipped kernel is.]]></description>

            <title>New attack against the SLUB allocator</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/984984/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Researchers from Graz University of Technology have
<a href="https://www.stefangast.eu/papers/slubstick.pdf">published</a> details of a new attack
on the Linux kernel called SLUBstack. The attack uses timing information to turn an ability to trigger use-after-free or double-free bugs into the ability to overwrite page tables, and thence into the ability to read and write arbitrary areas of memory. The good news is that this attack does require an existing bug to be usable; the bad news is that the kernel regularly sees bugs of this kind.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
We assume that an unprivileged user has code execution. 
Additionally, we consider the presence of a heap vulnerability
in the Linux kernel. We assume that the Linux kernel 
incorporates all defense mechanisms available in version 6.4, the
most recent Linux kernel version when we started our work.
These mechanisms include features such as WˆX, KASLR,
SMAP, and kCFI. We do not assume any microarchitectural 
vulnerabilities, e.g., transient execution, fault
injection, or hardware side channels.

a web-browser vulnerability that has been named "0.0.0.0 day".  In short,
browsers will allow JavaScript code to open connections to the all-zeroes
IPv4 address; the result is that any port that is open on the local host
can be accessed by a remote site.  "<q>When services use localhost, they

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983340/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
A <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/841797/">
bootstrappable build</a> is one that builds existing
software from scratch — for example, building GCC without relying on an existing
copy of GCC. In 2023, the Guix project
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/930650/">announced</a> that the project had reduced the size
of the binary bootstrap seed needed to build its operating system to just 357-bytes —
not counting the Linux kernel required to run the build process. Now, the
<a href="https://github.com/fosslinux/live-bootstrap">live-bootstrap</a> project
has gone a step further and removed the need for an existing kernel at all.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983105/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[At the 2024 <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>, John Groves led
a session on famfs, which is a filesystem he has developed that uses the
kernel's <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/dax.html">direct-access (DAX)</a>
mechanism to access memory that is shareable between hosts.  The discussion
was aimed at whether a different approach should be taken and, in
particular, whether FUSE should be used instead of implementing as an
in-kernel filesystem.  As noted in the <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240229002020.85535-1-john@groves.net/">thread</a> about his
proposal for an LSFMM+BPF session, and the mailing-list discussions on <a

href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/cover.1714409084.git.john@groves.net/">second
version</a> of his patch set, there is some skepticism that a new in-kernel
filesystem is warranted for the use case.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[One of the simplest hardening concepts to understand is that memory should
never be both writable and executable, otherwise an attacker can use it to
load and run arbitrary code.  That rule is generally followed in Linux
systems, but there is a glaring loophole that is exploitable from user
space to inject code into a running process.  Attackers have duly exploited
it.  A new effort to close the hole ran into trouble early in the merge
window, but a solution may yet be found in time for the 6.11 kernel

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983186/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/980447/">the previous episode</a> of the
<tt>vgetrandom()</tt> story, Jason Donenfeld had put together a version of
the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrandom.2.html"><tt>getrandom()</tt></a>
system call that ran in user space, significantly improving performance for
applications that need a lot of random data while retaining all of the
guarantees provided by the system call.  At that time, it seemed that a
consensus had built around the implementation and that it was headed toward
the mainline in that form.  A few milliseconds after that article was
posted, though, a Linus-Torvalds-shaped obstacle appeared in its path.
That obstacle has been overcome and this work has now been merged for the
6.11 kernel, but its form has changed somewhat.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982398/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On July 12, Jocelyn Falempe
<a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f42-change-proposal-enable-drm-panic-system-wide/125542">
proposed</a> a change to the configuration options that Fedora sets for its
kernels, in order to make kernel panics easier to report.
Falempe would like to enable the kernel's recently added
DRM-panic feature, which adds
a graphical crash screen that is reminiscent of the infamous
Windows "blue screen of death" for kernel panics. The feature introduces a few
tradeoffs, including currently limited driver support, so the proposal spawned a
good deal of discussion.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/984733/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Mozilla has <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/08/puppeteer-support-for-firefox/">announced</a> that <a href="https://pptr.dev/">Puppeteer</a>, a browser automation and testing library, now has first-class support for Firefox using the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/">WebDriver BiDi</a> protocol. Puppeteer can be used to drive headless browser instances, and is commonly used for automated end-to-end web site tests.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Whilst the features offered by Puppeteer won't be a surprise,
bringing support to multiple browsers has been a significant
undertaking. The Firefox support is not based on a Firefox-specific
automation protocol, but on WebDriver BiDi, a cross browser protocol
that's undergoing standardization at the W3C, and currently has
implementation in both Gecko and Chromium. This use of a
cross-browser protocol should make it much easier to support many
different browsers going forward.
