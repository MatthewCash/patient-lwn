on November&nbsp;30.  It contains GNOME&nbsp;47, Plasma&nbsp;6.2, LLVM&nbsp;19, and lots more:
<blockquote class="bq">

            <title>A kernel code of conduct enforcement action</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/999197/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The <a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/tab/start">Linux Foundation Technical
Advisory Board</a> (TAB) has <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/6740fc3aabec0_5eb129497@dwillia2-xfh.jf.intel.com.notmuch/">decided</a> to "<q>restrict Kent Overstreet's
participation in the kernel development process during the Linux 6.13
kernel development cycle</q>" based on a recommendation from the <a
href="https://kernel.org/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct
committee</a>.  In particular, the scope of the restriction will be to "<q>decline all pull
requests from Kent Overstreet</q>" during the development cycle.
Overstreet is the creator and maintainer of the <a
href="https://bcachefs.org/">bcachefs</a> filesystem.

<p>
This
action stems from a <a 
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/citv2v6f33hoidq75xd2spaqxf7nl5wbmmzma4wgmrwpoqidhj@k453tmq7vdrk/">message</a>
Overstreet posted back in early September that was abusive toward another
kernel developer; there is a fair amount of back-and-forth about the
incident and the committee's attempts to extract a public apology from
Overstreet in that thread.  Overstreet has published a <a
href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/116412665">lengthy blog post</a>
describing his side of the story.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Earlier today, one of our subscribers, anselm, posted the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1000000/">one millionth</a> item in our database during a discussion in the comments about the GPL. One million articles and comments is a big milestone — one representing twenty two years of work by both the editors of LWN and the community. I think reaching this milestone on Thanksgiving is a lovely coincidental reminder of how far LWN has come, and how that wouldn't have been possible without your support. So thank you for reading.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/999910/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.elementary.io/os-8-available-now/">Version
8</a> of the Ubuntu-based <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary OS</a> has been released. This
release includes a rewritten Dock, new window-management features,
improvements in the installation and initial setup procedures for
visually impaired users, as well as a new Secure Session mode:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
In the Secure Session, apps will be more restricted and will require
your consent for access to system features. When an app wants to
listen in the background for your keystrokes, take a screenshot,
record the screen, or even pick up the color from a single pixel, you
will be asked first to make sure that it's okay. The Secure Session
also comes with other modern features like support for Mixed DPI
modes—A hotly requested feature for folks using a HiDPI notebook or
tablet with a LoDPI external display—and improved support for
multi-touch gestures on touch screens and tablets.

kernel development cycle</q>" based on a recommendation from the <a
href="https://kernel.org/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct
committee</a>.  In particular, the scope of the restriction will be to "<q>decline all pull
requests from Kent Overstreet</q>" during the development cycle.
Overstreet is the creator and maintainer of the <a
href="https://bcachefs.org/">bcachefs</a> filesystem.

<p>
This
action stems from a <a 
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/citv2v6f33hoidq75xd2spaqxf7nl5wbmmzma4wgmrwpoqidhj@k453tmq7vdrk/">message</a>
Overstreet posted back in early September that was abusive toward another
kernel developer; there is a fair amount of back-and-forth about the
incident and the committee's attempts to extract a public apology from
Overstreet in that thread.  Overstreet has published a <a
href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/116412665">lengthy blog post</a>
describing his side of the story.]]></description>
