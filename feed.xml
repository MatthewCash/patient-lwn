            <title>Three stable kernels under the sky</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1010352/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman has released three more stable kernels:
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1010354/">6.13.3</a>,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1010356/">6.12.14</a>, and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1010357/">6.6.78</a>.
There was a bit of confusion that resulted in the patch for
<a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-21687">CVE 2025-21687</a>
getting applied twice — but that doesn't result in any problems for users of the
kernel, just a bit of extra noise in the CVE database, so Kroah-Hartman has
decided to leave the releases as-is instead of rushing another point release.

            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1010231/">6.14-rc3</a> kernel prepatch is out for
testing; the announcement, for unknown reasons, went only to the
linux-btrfs list.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	So the first few weeks of the 6.14 release development were
	smaller-than-usual, but rc3 is actually right in line with normal
	releases at this point. Probably just timing of pull requests, and
	we'll see how next week goes. But nothing looks worrisome.

<p>
Along with the usual stream of fixes, this release includes the "<a

for simple drivers that just need some sort of virtual bus to be associated
with; this bus come with <a

outset.]]></description>

            <title>[$] Exposing concurrency bugs with a custom scheduler</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1007689/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Jake Hillion gave
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4489-concurrency-testing-using-custom-linux-schedulers/">
a presentation</a> at
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/">
FOSDEM</a> about using
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/scheduler/sched-ext.html">
sched_ext</a>, the BPF
scheduling framework that was introduced in kernel version 6.12, to help find
elusive concurrency problems. In collaboration with Johannes Bechberger, he has
built a scheduler that can reveal theoretically possible but unobserved
concurrency bugs in test code in a few minutes. Since their scheduler only
relies on mainline kernel features, it can theoretically be applied to any
application that runs on Linux — although there are a number of caveats since
the project is still in its early days.

            <title>[$] An update on sealed system mappings</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006375/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Jeff Xu has been working on
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20241125202021.3684919-1-jeffxu@google.com/">
a patch set</a> that makes certain mappings in a process's address space
impossible to change, sealing them against tampering. This has some potential
security benefits — mainly, making
sure that someone cannot relocate the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/446528/">vsyscall and
vDSO mappings</a> — but some kernel developers haven't
been impressed with the patches.
While the core functionality (sealing the mappings) is sound, some of the
supporting code for enabling and disabling the new feature caused concern by
going against the normal design for such things. Reviewers also questioned
how this feature would interact with checkpointing and with sandboxing.

            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>, a free, general-purpose
programming language aimed at science, engineering, and related arenas of
technical computing, has steadily improved and widened its scope of

href="https://julialang.org/blog/2024/10/julia-1.11-highlights/">1.11&nbsp;release</a> from late 2024, Julia made several inroads into areas
outside of its traditional focus, provided its users with advances in
tooling, and has seen several improvements in performance and programmer
convenience.

around Julia go a long way to answer several longstanding complaints from
both new and experienced users. We last <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958337/">looked

            <description><![CDATA[While the path toward the ability to write device drivers in Rust has been
anything but smooth, steady progress has been made and that goal is close
to being achieved — for some types of drivers at least.  Device drivers
need to be able to set up memory areas for direct memory access (DMA)
transfers, though; that means Rust drivers will need a set of
abstractions to interface with the kernel's DMA-mapping subsystem.  Those
abstractions have run into resistance that has the potential to block
progress on the Rust-for-Linux project as a whole.]]></description>
