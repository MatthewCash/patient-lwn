            <title>Remote exploit of CUPS</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/991929/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Security researcher Simone Margaritelli 
<a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/">
has reported</a> a new vulnerability in 
<a href="https://openprinting.github.io/cups/">
CUPS</a>, the software that many Linux systems use to manage printers and print jobs. Margaritelli describes the impact of the attack by saying:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
A remote unauthenticated attacker can silently replace existing printers' (or install new ones) IPP urls with a malicious one, resulting in arbitrary command execution (on the computer) when a print job is started (from that computer).
</blockquote>

<p>
The vulnerability relies on a few related problems in CUPS libraries and utilities; versions before 2.0.1 or 2.1b1 (depending on the component) may be affected.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><a
href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-17-released-2936/">Version
17</a> of the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database has been released.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
This release of PostgreSQL adds significant overall performance gains,
including an overhauled memory management implementation for vacuum,
optimizations to storage access and improvements for high concurrency
workloads, speedups in bulk loading and exports, and query execution
improvements for indexes. PostgreSQL 17 has features that benefit
brand new workloads and critical systems alike, such as additions to
the developer experience with the SQL/JSON JSON_TABLE command, and
enhancements to logical replication that simplify management of high
availability workloads and major version upgrades.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/991899/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The online-privacy-focused <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor
project</a> has <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-tails-join-forces/">announced</a>
that it has "<q>joined forces and merged operations</q>" with the <a
href="https://tails.net/">Tails OS</a> Linux distribution.

<blockquote class="bq">
Countering the threat of global mass surveillance and censorship to a free Internet, Tor and Tails provide essential tools to help people around the world stay safe online. By joining forces, these two privacy advocates will pool their resources to focus on what matters most: ensuring that activists, journalists, other at-risk and everyday users will have access to improved digital security tools.
<p>
In late 2023, Tails approached the Tor Project with the idea of merging operations. Tails had outgrown its existing structure. Rather than expanding Tails's operational capacity on their own and putting more stress on Tails workers, merging with the Tor Project, with its larger and established operational framework, offered a solution. By joining forces, the Tails team can now focus on their core mission of maintaining and improving Tails OS, exploring more and complementary use cases while benefiting from the larger organizational structure of The Tor Project.

            <title>Eliminating Memory Safety Vulnerabilities at the Source
(Google Security Blog)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/991775/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Here's <a
href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html">a
post on the Google Security Blog</a> on how switching to a memory-safe
language can quickly reduce vulnerabilities in a project, even if a large
body of older code persists.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	 This leads to two important takeaways:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
    <li> The problem is overwhelmingly with new code, necessitating a
    fundamental change in how we develop code. 
    <li> Code matures and gets safer with time, exponentially, making the
    returns on investments like rewrites diminish over time as code gets
    older.
</ul>
<p>
For example, based on the average vulnerability lifetimes, 5-year-old code
has a 3.4x (using lifetimes from the study) to 7.4x (using lifetimes
observed in Android and Chromium) lower vulnerability density than new
code.

            <description><![CDATA[A Linux system is made up of a large number of interdependent components,
all of which must support each other well.  It can thus be surprising that,
it seems, the developers working on those components do not often speak
with each other.  In the hope of improving that situation, efforts have
been made in recent years to attract toolchain developers to the
kernel-heavy Linux Plumbers Conference.  This year, though, the opposite
happened as well: the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2024">2024
GNU Tools Cauldron</a> hosted a discussion where kernel developers were
invited to discuss their needs.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/990273/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://kangrejos.com/">
Kangrejos 2024</a> started off with a talk from Benno Lossin about his
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/982868/">recent work</a>
to establish a standard for safety documentation in Rust kernel code. Lossin
began his talk by giving a brief review of what safety documentation is, and
why it's needed, before moving on to the current status of his work. Safety
documentation is easier to read and write when there's a shared vocabulary for
discussing common requirements; Lossin wants to establish that shared vocabulary
for Rust code in the Linux kernel.

limited to the Clang compiler since the beginning; even developers who
use GCC to build kernels must use Clang to compile to BPF.  Work has

developers involved ran a session at the <a

an <a href="https://vanillaos.org/enterprise-support">enterprise
version with support</a>, and plans for an experimental version called
Vanilla OS Vision.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>We are not planning for a potential Vanilla OS 3 because it is not
yet necessary. As previously explained, our focus right now is on bug
fixing and making the system as solid as possible, especially in light
of collaborations with OEMs. We're all excited about laying the
foundation for a third version of Vanilla OS, but we have
responsibilities to attend to first.</p>

<p>This does not mean that there will never be one, nor does it mean
that Orchid will become stagnant. On the contrary, as previously
mentioned, our updates not only bring fixes but also updates to system
components, improvements to existing features, and updates to
components like GNOME (we are planning the release of GNOME 47 soon,
for example).</p>

            <title>Hy 1.0.0 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/991401/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Version 1.0.0 of <a
href="http://hylang.org/">Hy</a>, a Lisp dialect that is embedded in Python, has been <a
href="https://github.com/hylang/hy/discussions/2608">released</a>
after nearly 12 years in development. This is the first stable release of the project:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Henceforth, breaking changes to documented parts of the language
(other than dropping support for versions of Python that are
themselves no longer supported by the CPython developers) will
increase the major version number, and my intention is for that not to
happen often, if at all.
</blockquote>

<p>The 1.0.0 release supports Python 3.8 through 3.13. See the <a
href="http://hylang.org/hy/doc/v1.0.0">documentation</a> and the "<a
href="http://hylang.org/hy/doc/v1.0.0/whyhy">Why Hy?</a>" page for why
one might want to use it.</p>]]></description>
