            <title>A new crash reporter for Firefox</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/971006/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On April 23, Mozilla
<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/04/porting-a-cross-platform-gui-application-to-rust/">
announced</a> that Firefox's crash reporter has been rewritten in Rust, allowing the
project to address a backlog of issues.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Even though it is important to properly handle main process crashes, the crash
reporter hasn't received significant development in a while (aside from
development to ensure that crash reports and telemetry continue to reliably be
delivered)! It has long been stuck in a local maximum of "good enough" and
"scary to maintain": it features 3 individual GUI implementations (for Windows,
GTK+ for Linux, and macOS), glue code abstracting a few things (mostly in C++,
and Objective-C for macOS), a binary blob produced by obsoleted Apple
development tools, and no test suite. Because of this, there is a backlog of
features and improvements which haven't been acted on.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/971008/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
BleepingComputer
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-comments-abused-to-push-malware-via-microsoft-repo-urls/">
reported</a> on April 20 that some malware was being distributed via GitHub.
Uploading files as part of a comment gives them a URL that appears to be
associated with a repository, even if the comment is never posted.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>
A GitHub flaw, or possibly a design decision, is being abused by threat actors
to distribute malware using URLs associated with Microsoft repositories, making
the files appear trustworthy.
</p>

<p>
While most of the malware activity has been based around the Microsoft GitHub
URLs, this "flaw" could be abused with any public repository on GitHub, allowing
threat actors to create very convincing lures.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/970835/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Open Home Foundation has <a
href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/blog/announcing-the-open-home-foundation/">announced
its existence</a> as a home and support resource for free home-automation
projects.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	 We created the Open Home Foundation to fight for the fundamental
	 principles of privacy, choice, and sustainability for smart
	 homes. And every person who lives in one.
<p>
	 Ahead of today, we've transferred over 240 projects, standards,
	 drivers, and libraries—Home Assistant, ESPHome, Zigpy, Piper,
	 Improv Wi-Fi, Wyoming, and so many more—to the Open Home
	 Foundation. This is all about looking into the future. We've done
	 this to create a bulwark against surveillance capitalism, the risk
	 of buyout, and open-source projects becoming abandonware. To an
	 extent, this protection extends even against our future selves—so
	 that smart home users can continue to benefit for years, if not
	 decades. No matter what comes.

	eBPF was originally written for network packet filters but as of
	kernel v6.3 and thanks to Benjamin, we have BPF in the HID

	complicated things like "toggle that bit to zero" or "swap those

On April 3 security researcher Bartek Nowotarski

published</a> the details of a new denial-of-service (DoS)
attack, called a "continuation flood", against many

servers. While the attack is not terribly complex, it affects many independent
implementations of the HTTP/2 protocol, even though multiple
similar vulnerabilities over the years have given implementers plenty of warning.
