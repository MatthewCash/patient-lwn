            <title>PyPI now supports digital attestations</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998215/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Python Package Index (PyPI) has <a
href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-11-14-pypi-now-supports-digital-attestations/">announced</a>
that it has finalized support for <a
href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0740/">PEP 740</a> ("Index support
for digital attestations"). <a
href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a>, which performed
much of the development work for the implementation, has an <a
href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/11/14/attestations-a-new-generation-of-signatures-on-pypi/">in-depth
blog post</a> about the work and its adoption, as well as what is left
undone:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>One thing is notably missing from all of this work:
<strong>downstream verification</strong>. [...]</p>

<p>This isn't an acceptable end state (cryptographic attestations have
defensive properties only insofar as they're <strong><em>actually
verified</em></strong>), so we're looking into ways to bring
verification to individual installing clients. In particular, we're
currently working on a <a
href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12766">plugin architecture
for <tt>pip</tt></a> that will enable users to <a
href="https://github.com/trailofbits/pip-plugin-pep740">load
verification logic</a> directly into their <tt>pip install</tt>
flows.</p>

            <title>[$] Building secure images with NixOS</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/996329/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Image-based Linux distributions have seen increasing popularity, recently. They
promise reliability and security, but pose packaging problems for
existing distributions. Ryan Lahfa and Niklas Sturm spoke about the work that
NixOS has done to enable an image-based workflow at this year's
<a href="https://all-systems-go.io/">
All Systems Go!</a>
conference in Berlin.
Unfortunately, LWN was not able to cover the conference for scheduling reasons,
but the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAl27ciB6c8&list=PLWYdJViL9EipIImmvuoGFAeS-lKeHH2DD">
videos of the event</a> are available for anyone interested in watching the
talks.
Lahfa and Sturm explained that it is currently possible to create a
<a href="https://nixos.org/">
NixOS</a> system that
cryptographically verifies the kernel, initrd, and Nix store on boot â€” although
doing so still has some rough edges. Making an image-based NixOS installation is
similarly possible.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/995814/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Joshua Liebow-Feeser took to the stage at
<a href="https://rustconf.com">RustConf</a> to describe the methodology
that his team uses to encode
arbitrary constraints in the Rust type system when working on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuchsia_(operating_system)">
Fuchsia operating system</a>
(<a href="https://joshlf.com/files/talks/Safety%20in%20an%20Unsafe%20World.pdf">slides</a>).
The technique is not unknown to
the Rust community, but Liebow-Feeser did a good job of both explaining the
method and making a case for why it should be used more widely.

            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWrt</a> is, despite its relatively low
profile, one of our community's most important distributions; it runs
untold numbers of network routers and has served as the base on which a lot
of network-oriented development (including the <a

work</a>) has been done.  At the beginning of 2024, a few members of the
project <a

a plan to design and produce a router device specifically designed to run
OpenWrt.  This device, dubbed the "OpenWrt One", is now becoming available;
the kind folks at the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom
Conservancy</a> were kind enough to ship one to LWN, where the desire to
play with a new toy is never lacking.]]></description>
