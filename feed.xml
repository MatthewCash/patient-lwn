            <title>A revamped Python string-formatting proposal</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005000/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The proposal to add a more general facility for string formatting to
Python, which we <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/985346/">looked at</a> in August 2024,
has changed a great deal since, so it merits another look.  The
changes take multiple forms: a new title for <a
href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/">PEP
750</a> ("Template Strings"), a different mechanism for creating and using templates,
a new <tt>Template</tt> type to hold them, and several additional authors for the PEP.
Meanwhile, one controversial part of the original proposal, lazy evaluation
of the interpolated values, has been changed so that it requires an
explicit opt-in (via <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions"><tt>lambda</tt></a>);
template strings are a generalization of <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/919426/">f-strings</a> and lazy evaluation was seen by some
as a potentially confusing departure from their behavior.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The computer mouse is a wonderful invention, but for the past few
months I've been working to use mine as little as possible for
productivity and ergonomic reasons. It should not be surprising that
there are quite a few open-source applications, utilities, and
configuration options that are either designed to or incidentally
assist in creating a keyboard-driven desktop. This includes tiling window
management with <a

            <title>A look at the recent rsync vulnerability</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005302/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On January&nbsp;14, Nick Tait
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/CALDM2HfAOzs+zr3XLCDAKH8oOosigdaNooUANDf=Ez5mLSvQcQ@mail.gmail.com/">
announced</a> the discovery of six vulnerabilities in
<a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">
rsync</a>, the popular file-synchronization tool. While software vulnerabilities are
not uncommon, the
<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12084">
most serious one</a> he announced allows for remote code execution
on servers that run <tt>rsyncd</tt> â€” and possibly other configurations.
The bug itself is fairly simple, but this event provides a nice opportunity to
dig into it, show why it is so serious, and consider ways
the open-source community can prevent such mistakes in the
future.

            <title>LWN in EPUB format</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006562/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[For years we have had occasional requests to be able to receive LWN in
a format for ebook readers.  It took a while, but we are now happy to
announce that all of LWN's feature content is available, to subscribers at
the "professional hacker" level and above, in the EPUB format.  To obtain
the weekly edition as an EPUB file, just click the "Download EPUB" link in
the left column.  There is a separate <a href="https://lwn.net/headlines/">RSS feed</a>
for the EPUB format as well.  Any other feature content can be turned into
an ebook by appending <tt>/epub</tt> to its URL.
<p>
We will also be creating special EPUB books at times.  As an example of
what is possible, our complete coverage from <a
href="https://lwn.net/images/epub/kangrejos-2024.epub">Kangrejos 2024</a> and <a
href="https://lwn.net/images/epub/lsfmmbpf-2024.epub">the 2024 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> are available to all readers.
<p>
There are surely places where our EPUB books can be improved; please feel
free to drop us a note (at <a
href="mailto:lwn@lwn.net"><tt>lwn@lwn.net</tt></a>) with suggestions.]]></description>

            <title>Credential-leaking vulnerability in some Git credential managers</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006691/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Security researcher RyotaK
<a href="https://flatt.tech/research/posts/clone2leak-your-git-credentials-belong-to-us/">
has shared</a> a series of vulnerabilities that all have to do with how Git
interfaces with external
credential managers. In short, while Git guards against newline characters
(<tt>\n</tt>) being injected into a repository's URL, some programming languages
also treat carriage return characters (<tt>\r</tt>) as being newlines. Adding a
carriage return to a repository's URL can cause Git and the credential manager
to disagree on how the URL should be parsed, ultimately resulting in Git
credentials being sent to the wrong host. Malicious repositories could include
Git submodules with malformed URLs, triggering the bug. Only password-based authentication
with an external credential manager is
vulnerable to this attack; SSH-based authentication remains secure. The Git project
has chosen to consider this a vulnerability in Git, given the large amount of
external software affected. The project has fixed the bug on its end by
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.48.1.txt">
releasing updates</a> for all supported versions that ban
carriage returns in URLs entirely.
</p>

<p>
Affected software includes GitHub Desktop, Git LFS, and possibly other Git utilities:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Since Git itself doesn't use .lfsconfig file, specifying the URL that contains
the newline character in .lfsconfig causes Git LFS to insert the newline character
into the message, while bypassing [...] Git's validation.

            <title>Ubuntu developer discussion moving to Matrix</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006622/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ubuntu will be moving its "<q>official realtime communications
channels</q>" from IRC to Matrix, beginning March&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2025, following
a <a
href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2025-January/043224.html">discussion</a>
on the ubuntu-devel mailing list.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
"Official" communication, such as making realtime requests of privileged
Ubuntu developer teams, could be expected to be actioned if requested on
Matrix only. Similarly, you can consider your social responsibility to
other developers in relation to your work in Ubuntu development to be
fulfilled if you are present on that platform. And Canonical will
follow in its requirement for its employed Ubuntu developers to be
present on that agreed platform during their working hours.

            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20250127">DistroWatch
January 27 edition</a> includes this interesting tidbit:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Starting on January 19, 2025 Facebook's internal policy makers
	decided that Linux is malware and labeled groups associated with
	Linux as being "cybersecurity threats". Any posts mentioning
	DistroWatch and multiple groups associated with Linux and Linux
	discussions have either been shut down or had many of their posts
	removed.
<p>
	We've been hearing all week from readers who say they can no longer
	post about Linux on Facebook or share links to DistroWatch. Some
	people have reported their accounts have been locked or limited for
	posting about Linux.
