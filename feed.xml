            <title>A new release of Raspberry Pi OS</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/996332/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Raspberry Pi project has <a
href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/a-new-release-of-raspberry-pi-os/">announced</a>
a new version of Raspberry Pi OS. It includes a number of
significant changes, the most notable of which is that the Raspberry
Pi Desktop now uses Wayland by default for all Pi models using the
<a href="https://labwc.github.io/">labwc</a> compositor:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
For most of this year, we have been working on porting labwc to the
Raspberry Pi Desktop. This has very much been a collaborative process
with the developers of both labwc and wlroots: both have helped us
immensely with their support as we contribute features and
optimisations needed for our desktop.
</blockquote>

<p>This release also features Linux 6.6.51, improved touchscreen support, a new
screen configuration tool called <tt>raindrop</tt>, and more. See the
<a
href="https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_armhf/release_notes.txt">release
notes</a> for a full list of changes.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[A project called Flock has <a

project, motivated by frustration with the resources that Google is putting
into Flutter.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	We describe Flock as "Flutter+". In other words, we do not want, or
	intend, to fork the Flutter community. Flock will remain constantly

	won't implement.

            <title>[$] Using LKMM atomics in Rust</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/993785/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Rust, like C, has its own memory model describing how concurrent access to the
same data by multiple threads can behave.
The Linux kernel, however, has its own
ideas. The
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/718628/">
Linux kernel memory model</a> (LKMM) is subtly different from both the
standard C memory model and Rust's model.
At Kangrejos, Boqun Feng gave a presentation about the
need to reconcile the memory models used by Rust and the kernel,
including a few potential avenues for doing so. While
no consensus was reached, it is an area of active discussion.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Paul McKenney gave a presentation at Kangrejos this year that wasn't (directly)
related to Rust. Instead, he spoke about the work he has been doing in concert
with many other contributors on improving the handling of subtle concurrency
problems in C++.
Although he cautioned that his talk was only an overview, and not a
substitute for reading the relevant papers, he hoped that the things the C++
community is working on would be of interest to the Rust developers present as
well, and potentially inform future work on the language. McKenney's talk was,
as is his style, full of subtle examples of weird multithreaded behavior.

well-known either, Samuel Henrique said at the start of his <a

of software-engineering effort that has been put in place by the
distribution in order to create and maintain its releases, but "<q>loads of
people are not aware</q>" of it.  That may be due to the fact that all of
that is
not really documented anywhere in a central location that he can just point
someone to.  Recognizing that is what led him to give the talk;
hopefully it will be a "<q>first step toward</q>" helping solve the problem.]]></description>

At Kangrejos, Gary Guo wanted to discuss three problems with the way
Rust and C code in the kernel interact: mismatched types, too many type casts,
and the overhead of helper functions. To fix the first two problems, Guo proposed
changing the way the kernel maps C types into Rust types. The last problem was a
bit trickier, but he has a clever workaround for that, based on tricking
the compiler into inlining the helper functions across language boundaries.

            <title>[$] On Rust in enterprise kernels</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/993337/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[At the recently concluded Maintainers Summit, it was <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/991062/">generally agreed that the Rust experiment would
continue</a>, and that the path was clear for more Rust code to enter the
kernel.  But the high-level view taken at such gatherings cannot always
account for the difficult details that will inevitably arise as the Rust
work proceeds.  A recent discussion on the nouveau mailing list may have
escaped the notice of many, but it highlights some of the problems that
will have to be worked out as important functionality written in Rust heads
toward the mainline.]]></description>
