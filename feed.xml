            <title>Cohen: gccrs: An alternative compiler for Rust</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/997483/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Arthur Cohen has posted <a
href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/11/07/gccrs-an-alternative-compiler-for-rust.html">a
detailed introduction to the gccrs project</a> on the Rust Blog, seemingly
with the goal of convincing the Rust community about the value of the
project.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Likewise, many GCC plugins are used for increasing the safety of
	critical projects such as the Linux kernel, which has recently
	gained support for the Rust programming language. This makes
	<tt>gccrs</tt> a useful tool for analyzing unsafe Rust code, and
	more generally Rust code which has to interact with existing C
	code. We also want <tt>gccrs</tt> to be a useful tool for
	<tt>rustc</tt> itself by helping pan out the Rust specification
	effort with a unique viewpoint - that of a tool trying to replicate
	another's functionality, oftentimes through careful experimentation
	and source reading where the existing documentation did not go into
	enough detail.
</blockquote>

(LWN last <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/991199/">looked at gccrs</a> in October).]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The kernel graphics driver for the Apple M1 and M2 GPUs is, rather
famously, written in Rust, but it has achieved conformance with
various graphics standards, which is also noteworthy.  At the <a

(XDC)&nbsp;2024</a>, Alyssa Rosenzweig gave an update on the status of the
driver, along with some news about the kinds of games it can support (<a

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/995276/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The first program that Martin Pool ever wrote, he said, had bugs; the ones he's writing
now most likely have bugs too. The talk Pool gave at
<a href="https://rustconf.com/">RustConf</a> this year was about a way to try
to write programs with fewer bugs. He has developed a tool called
<a href="https://mutants.rs/">
cargo-mutants</a> that highlights gaps in test coverage by identifying
functions that can be broken without causing any tests to fail.
This can be a valuable complement to other testing techniques,
he explained.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/995125/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Sparrow Li presented virtually at
<a href="https://rustconf.com">
RustConf</a>&nbsp;2024 about the current state of and
future plans for the Rust compiler's performance. The compiler is relatively slow to compile
large programs, although it has been getting better over time. The next big
performance improvement to come will be parallelizing the compiler's parsing,
type-checking, and related operations, but even after that, the project has
several avenues left to explore.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/995159/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>
(OSI) has been working on defining <a
href="https://opensource.org/ai">Open Source AI</a>&mdash;that is what
constitutes an AI system that can be used, studied, modified, and
shared for any purpose&mdash;for almost two
years. Its <a
href="https://opensource.org/about/board-of-directors">board</a> will
be voting on the <a href="https://opensource.org/ai/drafts/the-open-source-ai-definition-1-0-rc2">Open Source AI Definition</a> (OSAID) on Sunday,
October&nbsp;27, with the 1.0 version slated to be published on
October&nbsp;28. It is never possible to please <em>everyone</em> in
such an endeavor, and it would be folly to make that a goal. However,
a number of prominent figures in the open-source community have voiced
concerns that OSI is setting the bar too low with the OSAID&mdash;which
will undo decades of community work to cajole vendors into adhering to
or respecting the original <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source
Definition</a> (OSD).</p>]]></description>

track</a> at the <a
href="https://lpc.events/event/18/page/224-lpc-2024-overview">2024 Linux

optimization and layout tool</a> (BOLT) that Meta uses on its production
kernels.  It optimizes the kernel binary by rearranging it to improve its

better performance.  A subsequent article will cover the second talk, which

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/997002/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[After a couple of years of effort, the BPF instruction set architecture has
been accepted as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9669.html">RFC
9669</a>, giving it a standard outside of the in-kernel implementation.  <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20241105035101.GD41004@maniforge">This message from David
Vernet</a> (who also contributed <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/926882/">an article on
the standardization process</a> last year) describes the process and why it
is important:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Though some vendors have already implemented BPF offloading
	capabilities without having a standardized ISA, others are not
	quite as risk tolerant. As Christoph [Hellwig] discussed at LSFMM
	2022, certain NVMe vendors have expressed an interest in building
	BPF offloading capabilities for various use cases such as eXpress
	Resubmission Path (XRP), but they simply can't fund such a project
	without certain components of BPF being standardized. Hence, the
	effort to standardize BPF was born.
