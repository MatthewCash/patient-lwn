6.10.14 is the last of the 6.10.y series, so users should now be moving to
6.11.y. Other than 6.6.56, they contain the usual long list of important
fixes throughout the kernel tree.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/991719/</link>

<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html">
BPF Type Format</a> (BTF),
BPF's debugging information format, has undergone rapid evolution to match
the evolving needs of BPF programs. José Marchesi spoke at Kangrejos about some
of that work — and how it could impact Rust, specifically. He discussed debug
information, kernel-specific relocations, and the planned changes to kernel
stack unwinding. Each of these will require some amount of work to fully
support in Rust, but preliminary signs look promising.

            <description><![CDATA[One concern that has often been expressed about the Rust language is that
there is only one compiler for it.  That makes it hard to say what the
standard version of the language is and restricts the architectures that
can be targeted by Rust code to those that the available compiler supports.
Adding a Rust frontend to GCC would do much to address those concerns; at
the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2024">2024 GNU Tools
Cauldron</a>, Pierre-Emmanuel Patry gave an update on the state of that
work and what its objectives are.]]></description>

patches included in its <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>

will be splitting out support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)">Kerberos</a> key exchange into a
separate set of packages, though not until after the Debian&nbsp;13
("trixie") release expected next year. The impact on Debian users
should be minimal, but it is an interesting look into the changes
Linux distributions make to upstream software as well as some of the
long-term consequences of those choices.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/990918/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Danilo Krummrich gave a talk at Kangrejos 2024 focusing on the question of how
the Rust-for-Linux project could improve at getting device and driver
abstractions upstream. As a case study, he used some of his recent work that
attempts to make it possible to write a PCI driver entirely in Rust. There
wasn't time to go into as much detail as he would have liked, but he did
demonstrate that it is possible to interface with the kernel's module loader in
a way that is much harder to
screw up than the current standard approach in C.

sched_ext community held one of its first public gatherings; sched_ext
would appear to have launched a new burst of creativity in scheduler

<blockquote class="bq">
In previous Julia versions, there was no "programmatic way" of knowing if an unexported name was considered part of the public API or not. Instead, the guideline was basically that if it was not in the manual then it was not public which was a bit underwhelming. To remedy that, there is now a <tt>public</tt> keyword in Julia that can be used to indicate that an unexported name is part of the public API.

            <title>Kernel prepatch 6.12-rc2</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/993107/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Linus has released <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/993106/">6.12-rc2</a> for testing.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Anyway, this isn't one of the small rc2's. But looking at
	historical trends, being a bigger rc2 isn't _that_ unusual, and
	nothing in here looks all that odd. Yes, the diffstat may look a
	bit unusual, in that we had a global header renaming
	(asm/unaligned.h -&gt; linux/unaligned.h) and we had a couple of
	reverts that stand out as spikes in the stats, but everything else
	looks nice and small.

            <title>Akamai finds many systems with exposed CUPS vulnerability</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/993044/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Akamai
<a href="https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/october-cups-ddos-threat">
released a report</a> pointing out that the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/991929/">
recently-reported CUPS vulnerability</a>
(<a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/">original disclosure</a>)
could be used to drive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks as well. Even if an attacker cannot gain remote control over a computer, they can still cause it to fetch a URL of their choice — potentially getting free DDoS amplification.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
The Akamai Security Intelligence and Response Team (SIRT) found that more than 198,000 devices are vulnerable to this attack vector and are accessible on the public internet; roughly 34% of those could be used for DDoS abuse (58,000+).
