            <title>Another OpenSSH remote code execution vulnerability</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981287/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Alexander "Solar Designer" Peslyak has <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240708162106.GA4920@openwall.com">disclosed another OpenSSH
vulnerability</a> that can be exploited for remote code execution, but only
on distributions that have applied a patch to add auditing support.
Specifically, RHEL&nbsp;9 and derivatives are affected, as are
Fedora&nbsp;36 and&nbsp;37 (but not later releases).
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The main difference from CVE-2024-6387 is that the race condition
	and RCE potential are triggered in the privsep child process, which
	runs with reduced privileges compared to the parent server process.
	So immediate impact is lower.  However, there may be differences in
	exploitability of these vulnerabilities in a particular scenario,
	which could make either one of these a more attractive choice for
	an attacker, and if only one of these is fixed or mitigated then
	the other becomes more relevant.

            <title>Esfahbod: State of Text Rendering 2024</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981178/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[On his blog, Behdad Esfahbod has <a href="https://behdad.org/text2024/">published</a> a lengthy and detailed look at the state of open-source text rendering.  It looks at the libraries available, application support, future directions, and gives a summary analysis of the ecosystem. 

<blockquote class="bq">
In broad strokes, OpenType added support for <i>color fonts</i>, <i>variable fonts</i>, and the <i>Universal Shaping Engine</i>. The Free &amp; Open Source stack supports all of these advances at the lower level, but application UI support has been slower to arrive. The Open Source text stack also gained enormous market-share when Android and Google Chrome fully embraced it.
<p>
Looking forward, there is a <i>Rust</i> migration of the text stack underway, which will unify font compilation and consumption under a safe programming language. <i>Incremental Font Transfer</i> will enable streaming fonts to web browsers. And my proposed <i>Wasm-fonts</i> will enable more expressive fonts.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/">
Unison</a> is a
MIT-licensed programming language, in development since 2013, that
explores the ramifications of making code immutable and stored in a database,
instead of a set of text files.
Unison supports a greatly simplified model for distributed
programming — one that describes the configuration of and communication between
programs in the same language as the programs themselves. Along the way, it
introduces a new approach to interfacing with programming languages, which is tailored to
its design.

Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo spoke at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>
about his work on
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/335942/">
Poke-a-hole</a> (pahole),
a program that has expanded greatly over the years, but which was relevant to the
BPF track because it produces BPF Type Format (BTF) information from DWARF
debugging information. He covered some small changes to the program, and then
went into detail about the new support for data-type profiling. His
<a href="http://vger.kernel.org/~acme/prez/lsfmm-bpf-2024/">slides</a> include
several examples.

            <title>Universal Blue images need manual intervention for updates</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/980575/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://universal-blue.org/">Universal Blue</a>
project, which produces operating system images based on Fedora's <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/">Atomic Desktops</a>,
has issued an <a
href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/important-announcement-regarding-system-updates-action-needed/2689/1">announcement</a>
that manual steps are required to continue receiving updates. Jorge
Castro wrote:</p>


<blockquote class="bq">
<p>If you use Bazzite, Bluefin, Aurora, or any other Universal Blue
image (including our toolboxes) then you need to follow the
instructions in this announcement in order to ensure that your device
is getting updates. We were rotating our cosign keypairs this morning,
which is the method that we use to sign our images.</p>


<p>During this process I made a critical error which has resulted in
forcing you to take manual steps to migrate to our newly signed
images.</p>

<p>This applies to all Universal Blue images released before July 2,
2024. See the full announcement for instructions. LWN <a

December, 2023.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Rosenthal: X Window System At 40</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/980556/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[David Rosenthal <a
href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/x-window-system-at-40.html">looks
back</a> at 40 years of the X Window System:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	A major reason for Sun's early success was that they in effect
	open-sourced the Network File System. X11 was open source under the
	MIT license. I, and some of the other Sun engineers, understood
	that NeWS could not displace X11 as the Unix standard window system
	without being equally open source. But Sun's management looked at
	NeWS and saw superior technology, an extension of the PostScript
	that Adobe was selling, and couldn't bring themselves to give it
	away.
