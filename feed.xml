            <title>[$] A review of file descriptor memory safety in the kernel</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/985853/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On July 30, Al Viro sent
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240730050927.GC5334@ZenIV/">
a patch set</a> to the linux-fsdevel mailing list with a
comprehensive cover letter explaining his
recent work on ensuring that the kernel's internal representation of
file descriptors are used correctly in the kernel.
File descriptors are ubiquitous; many system calls
need to handle them. Viro's review
identified a few existing bugs, and may prevent more in the future. He also had
suggestions for ways to keep uses consistent throughout the kernel.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/974969/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Linux installers receive a disproportionate amount of attention
compared to the amount of time that most users spend with them. Ideally,
a user spends only a few minutes using the installer, versus years using
the distribution after it is installed. Yet, the installer sets the
first impression, and if it fails to do its job, little else matters.
Installers also have to continually evolve to keep pace with new
hardware, changes in distribution packaging (such as image-based Linux
distributions), and so forth. Along those lines, the SUSE team that maintains the
venerable <a href="https://yast.opensuse.org/">YaST</a> installer has
decided it's time to start (almost) fresh with a new Linux installer
project, called <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/agama">Agama</a>,
for new projects. YaST is not going away as an administration tool,
but it is likely to be relieved of installer duties at some point.</p>]]></description>

<a

Pennsylvania, Anthony Shaw looked at the various kinds of parallelism

global interpreter lock (GIL), along with the work to <a

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/986174/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[One tactic often used by attackers set on compromising a system is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_spraying">heap spraying</a>; in
short, the attacker fills as much of the heap as possible with crafted data
in the hope of getting the target system to use that data in a bad way.  If
heap spraying can be blocked, attackers will lose an important tool.  The
kernel has some heap-spraying defenses now, including the <a

upcoming 6.11 release, but its author, Kees Cook, thinks that more can be

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD Project</a> is, for the second
time this year, engaging in a long-running discussion about the
possibility of including Rust in its <a

system</a>. The sequel to the first discussion included some work by
Alan Somers to show what it might look like to use Rust code in the

included in FreeBSD's base system, but the conversation has been
enlightening.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/985346/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Python has had
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/656898/">formatted string literals</a>
(<span style="white-space:nowrap">f-strings</span>), a syntactic shorthand for building
strings, since 2015. Recently, Jim Baker, Guido van Rossum, and Paul Everitt have
proposed
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/">
PEP 750</a> ("Tag Strings For Writing Domain-Specific Languages") which would
generalize and expand that mechanism to provide Python library writers with additional
flexibility. Reactions to the proposed change were somewhat positive, although
there was a good deal of discussion of (and opposition to)
the PEP's inclusion of lazy evaluation of template parameters.

            <title>Garrett: What is an SBAT and why does everyone suddenly care</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/986844/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Matthew Garrett <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/70348.html">describes
the role of the Secure Boot Advanced Targeting mechanism</a> and how it
played into the recent Windows upgrade problems.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	So why is this suddenly relevant? SBAT was developed
	collaboratively between the Linux community and Microsoft, and
	Microsoft chose to push a Windows update that told systems not to
	trust versions of grub with a security generation below a certain
	level. This was because those versions of grub had genuine security
	vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to compromise the
	Windows secure boot chain, and we've seen real world examples of
	malware wanting to do that.
