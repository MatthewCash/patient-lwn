            <title>Reviving None-aware operators for Python</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1004893/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The idea of adding <tt>None</tt>-aware operators to Python has sprung up once
again. These would make traversing structures with <tt>None</tt> values in them
easier, by short-circuiting lookups when a <tt>None</tt> is encountered. Almost
exactly a year ago, LWN covered <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/956862/">the previous attempt</a> to bring
the operators to Python, but there have been periodic discussions stretching back to
2015 and possibly before. This time Noah Kim has taken up the cause. After some debate, he
eventually settled on redrafting the existing PEP to have a more limited scope,
which might finally see it move past the cycle of debate, resurrection, and abandonment that
it has been stuck in for most of the last decade.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005222/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The kernel is, on its face, a single large development project, but
internally it is better viewed as 100 or so semi-independent projects all
crammed into one big tent.  Within those projects, there is a fair amount
of latitude about how changes are managed, and some subsystems are using
that freedom in the search for more efficient ways of working.  In the end,
though, all of these sub-projects have to work together and interface with
kernel-wide efforts, including the stable-release and CVE-assignment
processes.  For some time, there has been friction between the direct
rendering (DRM, or graphics) subsystem and the stable maintainers; that
friction recently burst into view in a way that shows some of the
limitations of how the kernel community manages patches.]]></description>

The

Sequoia</a> OpenPGP library has been in development for some time. LWN

command-line interface has
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1002411/">been released</a>. The <tt>sq</tt> tool offers a
promising alternative to the venerable

GNU Privacy Guard</a> (GPG) tool — albeit one with a
different interface, set of terminology, and approach to the web of
trust. Several distributions are making increasing use of the tool
behind the scenes.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001224/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The
<a href="https://www.ponylang.io/">Pony</a> programming language is dedicated to
exploring how to make high-performance
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">
actor-based</a> systems. Started in 2014,
the language's most notable feature is probably
<a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.io/reference-capabilities/">
reference capabilities</a>, a system of pointer annotations that gives the developer
fine manual control over how data is shared between actors, while simultaneously
ensuring that Pony programs don't have data races. The language is not likely to
overtake other more popular programming languages, but its ideas could be useful for
other languages or frameworks struggling with concurrent data access.

            <title>[$] The Homa network protocol</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003059/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The origins of the TCP and UDP network protocols can be traced back a full
50&nbsp;years.  Even though networks and their use have changed radically
since those protocols were designed, they can still be found behind most
networking applications.  Unsurprisingly, these protocols are not optimal
for all situations, so there is ongoing interest in the development of
alternatives.  One such is the <a
href="https://homa-transport.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOMA/overview">Homa
transport protocol</a>, developed by John Ousterhout (of <a
href="https://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl/Tk</a> and <a
href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> fame, among other accomplishments),
which is aimed at data-center applications.  Ousterhout is currently trying
to get <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20241217000626.2958-1-ouster@cs.stanford.edu">a
minimal Homa implementation</a> into the kernel.]]></description>

            <title>Six vulnerabilities discovered in rsync</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005129/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Nick Tait
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/14/3">announced</a> on the
oss-security mailing list that
<a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">
rsync</a>, the widely used file transfer program, had a number of serious vulnerabilities.
Users can mitigate all six vulnerabilities by upgrading to
version 3.4.0, which was 
<a href="https://lists.samba.org/archive/rsync-announce/2025/000120.html">
released</a> on January 14. While all users should upgrade, servers that use rsyncd are
especially impacted:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
In the most severe CVE, an attacker only requires
anonymous read access to a rsync server, such as a public mirror, to
execute arbitrary code on the machine the server is running on.
