            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003547/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Continuing its tradition of yearly major releases on December 25, the <a

has <a
href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/12/25/ruby-3-4-0-released/">released
Ruby 3.4.0</a> (followed quickly by <a
href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/12/25/ruby-3-4-1-released/">3.4.1</a>,
which simply updates the version number).  Ruby 3.4 includes lots of
changes, including the addition of <a
href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18980"><tt>it</tt></a> as a
less-confusing shorthand for <tt>_1</tt> as a block parameter, switching to
<a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20564">Prism as the default
parser</a>, adding the <a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8305">Happy Eyeballs
version&nbsp;2</a> algorithm to the socket library,
just-in-time (JIT) compiler (YJIT) improvements, garbage-collection
modularization, and more.]]></description>

            <title>[$] Emacs code completion can cause compromise</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1002046/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Emacs has had a
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/966547/">few bugs</a> related to accidentally
permitting the execution of untrusted code. Unfortunately, it seems as though
another bug of that sort has appeared — and may be harder to patch,
because the problem comes from the way Emacs handles expansion of Lisp macros in
code being analyzed. The
vulnerability is only practically exploitable in a non-default configuration, so
not every Emacs user has something to worry about. The Emacs
developers are reportedly working on a fix, but have not yet shared details
about it. In the meantime, every Emacs version since at least
26.1 (released in May&nbsp;2018) through the current development version is vulnerable.

            <title>[$] Using Guile for Emacs</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001645/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is, famously, an
editor—perhaps far more—that is extensible using its own
variant of the Lisp programming language, <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/">Emacs
Lisp</a> (or Elisp).  <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2024/">This year's
edition of EmacsConf</a>, which is an annual "gathering" that has been held
online for the past five years, had two separate talks on using a different
variant of Lisp, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile</a>,
for Emacs.  Both projects would preserve Elisp compatibility, which is a
must, but they would use Guile differently.  The first talk we will cover
was given by Robin Templeton, who described the relaunch of the <a
href="https://guile-emacs.org/">Guile-Emacs project</a>, which would replace
the Elisp in Emacs with a compiler using Guile.  A subsequent article will look
at the other talk, which is about <a
href="https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/gypsum/">an Emacs clone</a> written
using Guile.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001526/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Commits in the Git source-code management system are identified by the
SHA-1 hash of their contents — though the specific hash <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/898522/">may change someday</a>.  The full hash is a
160-bit quantity, normally written as a 40-character hexadecimal string.
While those strings are convenient for computers to work with, humans find
them to be a bit unwieldy, so it is common to abbreviate the hash values to
shorter strings.  Geert Uytterhoeven recently <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/cover.1733421037.git.geert+renesas@glider.be">proposed</a>
increasing the length of those abbreviated hashes as used in the kernel
community, but the problem he was working to solve may not be as urgent as
it seems.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1000434/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Handling time in a networked environment is never easy. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">
Network Time Protocol</a> (NTP) has been used to synchronize clocks across the
internet for almost 40 years — but, as computers and networks get faster, the
degree of synchronization it offers is not sufficient for some use cases. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol">
Precision Time Protocol</a> (PTP) attempts to provide more precise
time synchronization, at the
expense of requiring dedicated kernel and hardware
support. The Linux kernel has
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d94ba80ebbea17f036cecb104398fbcd788aa742">
supported PTP</a> since 2011, but the protocol has recently seen
<a href="https://www.broadcom.com/blog/time-synchronization-in-data-center-networks">
increasing use in data centers</a>. As PTP becomes more widespread, it may be
useful to have an idea how it compares to NTP.

            <description><![CDATA[Curl maintainer Daniel Stenberg <a

that the curl project will be dropping hyper, its experimental HTTP backend
written in Rust, due to lack of developer interest.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	While the experiment itself is deemed a failure, I think we learned
	from it and improved curl in the process. We had to rethink and
	reassess several implementation details when we aligned HTTP
	behavior with hyper. libcurl parses and handles HTTP stricter
	now. Better.
