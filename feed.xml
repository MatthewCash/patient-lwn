            <title>GNOME Foundation Announces Transition of Executive Director</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981850/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/">GNOME Foundation</a> has <a
href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2024/07/12/gnome-foundation-announces-transition-of-executive-director/">announced</a>
that executive director Holly Million is stepping down at the end of
July, and will be replaced by Richard Littauer as interim executive
director:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>On behalf of the whole GNOME community, the Board of Directors
would like to give our utmost thanks to Holly for her achievements
during the past 10 months, including drafting a bold five-year
strategic plan for the Foundation, securing two important fiscal
sponsorship agreements with GIMP and Black Python Devs, writing our
first funding proposal that will now enable the Foundation to apply
for more grants, vastly improving our financial operations, and
implementing a break-even budget to preserve our financial
reserves.</p>

<p>The Foundation's Interim Executive Director, Richard Littauer,
brings years of open source leadership as part of his work as an
organizer of SustainOSS and CURIOSS, as a sustainability coordinator
at the Open Source Initiative, and as a community development manager
at Open Source Collective, and through open source contributions to
many projects, such as Node.js and IPFS. The Board appointed Richard
in June and is confident in his ability to guide the Foundation during
this transitional period.
</blockquote>

<p>Million says she is leaving to pursue a PhD in psychology. The
board plans to announce its search plan for a permanent executive
directory after <a
href="https://events.gnome.org/event/209/">GUADEC</a>, which takes
place July 19 through 24.</p>

            <title>An empirical study of Rust for Linux</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981635/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The research value of <a
href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc24/presentation/li-hongyu">this
USENIX paper</a> by Hongyu Li et al. is not entirely clear, but it does
show that the Rust-for-Linux project is gaining wider attention.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Despite more novice developers being attracted by Rust to the
	kernel community, we have found their commits are mainly for
	constructing Rust-relevant toolchains as well as Rust crates alone;
	they do not, however, take part in kernel code development. By
	contrast, 5 out of 6 investigated drivers (as seen in Table 5) are
	mainly contributed by authors from the Linux community. This
	implies a disconnection be- tween the young and the seasoned
	developers, and that the bar of kernel programming is not lowered
	by Rust language.

            <description><![CDATA[Like many kernel subsystems, the Linux security module (LSM) subsystem
makes extensive use of indirect function calls.  Those calls, however, are
increasingly problematic, and the pressure to remove them has been growing. 
The good news is that there is <a

series</a> from KP Singh that accomplishes that goal.  Its progress into

up in some wider controversies along the way, but it should be close to
being ready.]]></description>

On May 7, Kees Cook sent
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/202404291502.612E0A10@keescook/">
a proposal</a> to the linux-kernel mailing list, asking for the kernel
developers to start
working on a way to mitigate unintentional arithmetic overflow, which has been a
source of many bugs. This is not the first time Cook has made a request along
these lines; he <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/959189/">sent a related patch set</a> in
January 2024.
Several core developers objected to the plan for different
reasons. After receiving their feedback,
Cook modified his approach to tackle the problem
in a series of smaller steps.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
With the
<a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">
Rust-for-Linux</a> project starting to gain some ground, it is worth
looking at other operating systems that use Rust in their kernels. There
are <a href="https://github.com/flosse/rust-os-comparison">
many</a> attempts to use
Rust for operating system development, but <a href="https://redox-os.org/">Redox</a>
may be the most complete.
Redox is an MIT-licensed microkernel and corresponding user space, designed
around concepts taken from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs">

replacement for Linux, it already provides a graphical user interface and

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Doug Brown <a
href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2024/07/i-fixed-a-6-year-old-deb-installation-bug-in-ubuntu-mate-and-xubuntu/">documents
the long journey</a> to fixing a bug in the <a
href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDebi">GDebi</a> utility for
installing Debian packages. He first encountered the bug in
Ubuntu&nbsp;MATE&nbsp;18.04: "<q>at the time I just ignored this
issue. I didn't want to deal with it. I went off to the trusty Linux
terminal and installed Chrome that way instead</q>".</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Two and a half years ago, I committed to doing more open-source
contributions in my free time and was finally irritated enough about
this problem to look into it. I searched around for more info. Lo and
behold, <a
href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/985009/gdebi-installer-exits-without-installing-the-deb-file-in-17-10">lots
of</a> <a href="https://dev1galaxy.org/viewtopic.php?id=4900">people

affected</a> and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdebi/+bug/1854588">there was already an
issue from 2019 on Ubuntu's bug tracker</a> about it.</p>

<p>[...] As is commonly the case in software development, the difficult part of
this fix had nothing to do with the code itself. All of my effort was
spent figuring out Ubuntu's patch submission processes and advocating
for my merge request. Nobody else seemed to be interested in doing the
work to actually fix this bug that has been plaguing Ubuntu MATE and
Xubuntu, not to mention some Debian users, for over 6 years. After
dealing with the long process of getting my merge request approved, I
think I'm starting to understand why!

<p>Brown notes that the fix <a

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981561/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Fedora <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/">Atomic Desktop</a>
and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/iot/">Fedora IoT</a> systems installed
before Fedora&nbsp;40 may fail to boot after an update if secure boot
is enabled. Fedora Magazine has <a
href="https://fedoramagazine.org/manual-action-needed-to-resolve-boot-failure-for-fedora-atomic-desktops-and-fedora-iot/">a
post</a> by Timothée Ravier about the problem, how users can work
around it, and what the project is doing to avoid the similar problems
in the future:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>On Fedora Atomic Desktops and Fedora IoT systems, the components
that are part of the boot chain (Shim, GRUB) are not (yet)
automatically updated alongside the rest of the system. Thus, if you
have installed a Fedora Atomic Desktop or a Fedora IoT system before
Fedora 40, it uses an old versions of the Shim and bootloader binaries
to boot your system.</p>

<p>When Secure Boot is enabled, the EFI firmware loads Shim
first. Shim is signed by the Microsoft Third Party Certificate
Authority so that it can be verified on most hardware out of the
box. The Shim binary includes the Fedora certificates used to verify
binaries signed by Fedora. Then Shim loads GRUB, which in turn loads
the Linux kernel. Both are signed by Fedora.</p>

<p>Until recently, the kernel binaries where signed two times, with an
older key and a newer one. With the 6.9 kernel update, the kernel is
no longer signed with the old key. If GRUB or Shim is old enough and
does not know about the new key, the signature verification fails.</p>

            <title>Another OpenSSH remote code execution vulnerability</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981287/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Alexander "Solar Designer" Peslyak has <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240708162106.GA4920@openwall.com">disclosed another OpenSSH
vulnerability</a> that can be exploited for remote code execution, but only
on distributions that have applied a patch to add auditing support.
Specifically, RHEL&nbsp;9 and derivatives are affected, as are
Fedora&nbsp;36 and&nbsp;37 (but not later releases).
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The main difference from CVE-2024-6387 is that the race condition
	and RCE potential are triggered in the privsep child process, which
	runs with reduced privileges compared to the parent server process.
	So immediate impact is lower.  However, there may be differences in
	exploitability of these vulnerabilities in a particular scenario,
	which could make either one of these a more attractive choice for
	an attacker, and if only one of these is fixed or mitigated then
	the other becomes more relevant.

            <title>Stable kernel update 6.6.38</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981256/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/981255/">6.6.38</a> stable kernel update has been
released, without the benefit of the usual review process.  It reverts some
BPF changes with patches that do not appear in the mainline (in this form,
at least).  "<q>All powerpc and arm64 users of the 6.6 kernel series must
upgrade.  Everyone else probably should as well to be safe.</q>"]]></description>

            <title>Esfahbod: State of Text Rendering 2024</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981178/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[On his blog, Behdad Esfahbod has <a href="https://behdad.org/text2024/">published</a> a lengthy and detailed look at the state of open-source text rendering.  It looks at the libraries available, application support, future directions, and gives a summary analysis of the ecosystem. 

<blockquote class="bq">
In broad strokes, OpenType added support for <i>color fonts</i>, <i>variable fonts</i>, and the <i>Universal Shaping Engine</i>. The Free &amp; Open Source stack supports all of these advances at the lower level, but application UI support has been slower to arrive. The Open Source text stack also gained enormous market-share when Android and Google Chrome fully embraced it.
<p>
Looking forward, there is a <i>Rust</i> migration of the text stack underway, which will unify font compilation and consumption under a safe programming language. <i>Incremental Font Transfer</i> will enable streaming fonts to web browsers. And my proposed <i>Wasm-fonts</i> will enable more expressive fonts.

testing.

	Things remain calm, although I do suspect that part of it is that
	it's been the July 4th week in the US, and a lot of Europe is
	starting to go away on summer vacation.
<p>
	But hey, let's not look a gift horse too closely in the
	mouth. Maybe it's really just that 6.10 is shaping up well. Right?
	RIGHT?
