            <title>A kernel code of conduct enforcement action</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/999197/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The <a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/tab/start">Linux Foundation Technical
Advisory Board</a> (TAB) has <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/6740fc3aabec0_5eb129497@dwillia2-xfh.jf.intel.com.notmuch/">decided</a> to "<q>restrict Kent Overstreet's
participation in the kernel development process during the Linux 6.13
kernel development cycle</q>" based on a recommendation from the <a
href="https://kernel.org/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct
committee</a>.  In particular, the scope of the restriction will be to "<q>decline all pull
requests from Kent Overstreet</q>" during the development cycle.
Overstreet is the creator and maintainer of the <a
href="https://bcachefs.org/">bcachefs</a> filesystem.

<p>
This
action stems from a <a 
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/citv2v6f33hoidq75xd2spaqxf7nl5wbmmzma4wgmrwpoqidhj@k453tmq7vdrk/">message</a>
Overstreet posted back in early September that was abusive toward another
kernel developer; there is a fair amount of back-and-forth about the
incident and the committee's attempts to extract a public apology from
Overstreet in that thread.  Overstreet has published a <a
href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/116412665">lengthy blog post</a>
describing his side of the story.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Programming language polyglots are files that are valid
programs in multiple languages, and do different things in each. While polyglots are normally
nothing more than a curiosity, the
<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html">
Cosmopolitan Libc</a> project has been trying
to put them to a novel use: producing native, multi-platform binaries that
run directly on several operating systems and architectures. There are still
some rough edges with the project's approach, but it is generally possible to
build C programs into a polyglot format with with minimal
tweaking.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://github.com/bit-team/backintime?tab=readme-ov-file#back-in-time">
Back In Time</a> is a GPL-2.0-licensed backup tool based on
<a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">
rsync</a> and written in Python. It has both graphical and command-line interfaces, and
supports backups to local disks or over SSH.
Back In Time was originally written by
Oprea Dan and released in 2009. The tool has been
through some rough patches over the years, and is currently on its third set of
maintainers. Christian Buhtz, one of the current maintainers, explained to me
how he and his co-maintainers had revived the project, as well as why he thought
Back In Time stood out from all of the existing backup solutions.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/995915/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Fedora Linux, as a rule, handles version upgrades reasonably
well. However, there are times when users may want to do a fresh
installation rather than an upgrade <em>but</em> preserve existing
users and data under <tt>/home</tt>. This is a scenario that the
Fedora installer, currently, does not address. Users can maintain a
separate <tt>/home</tt> partition, of course, but the installer does
not incorporate existing users into the new install&mdash;that is an
exercise left to the user to handle. One solution might be to use <a
href="https://systemd.io/HOME_DIRECTORY/">systemd-homed</a>, a systemd
service for managing users and home directories. However, a discussion
proposing the use systemd-homed as part of Fedora installation
uncovered some hurdles, such as trying to blend its approach to
managing users with tools that centralize user management.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Flexible arrays â€” arrays that are declared as the final member of a
structure and which have a size determined at run time â€” have long drawn
the attention of developers seeking to harden the kernel against
buffer-overflow vulnerabilities.  These arrays have reliably been a source
of bugs, so anything that can be done to ensure that operations on them
stay within bounds is a welcome improvement.  While many improvements,
including the recent <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/936728/">counted-by work</a>, have
been made, one of the most difficult cases remains.  Now, however,

            <title>Plans for CHICKEN 6</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/998856/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://www.call-cc.org/">
CHICKEN Scheme</a>, a portable Scheme compiler, is gearing up for its next major release. Maintainer Felix Winkelmann has
shared
<a href="https://www.more-magic.net/posts/chicken-6.html">
an article</a> about what changes to expect in version 6 of the language, including better Unicode support and support for the
<a href="https://r7rs.org/">
R7RS</a> Scheme standard.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Every major release is a chance of fixing long-standing problems with the codebase and address bad design decisions. CHICKEN is now nearly 25 years old and we had many major overhauls of the system. Sometimes these caused a lot of pain, but still we always try to improve things and hopefully make it more enjoyable and practical for our users. There are places in the code that are messy, too complex, or that require cleanup or rewrite, always sitting there waiting to be addressed. On the other hand CHICKEN has been relatively stable compared to many other language implementations and has a priceless community of users that help us improving it. Our users never stop reminding us of what could be better, where the shortcomings are, where things are hard to use or inefficient.

about each vulnerability, its impact, and the measures implemented to
improve the security of FreeBSD systems. [...]</p>

<p>The audit uncovered 27 vulnerabilities and issues within various
FreeBSD subsystems. 7 issues were not exploitable and were robustness
or code quality improvements rather than immediate security concerns.</p>
