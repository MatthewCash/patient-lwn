            <title>[$] Improving pseudo filesystems</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981155/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The eventfs filesystem provides an interface to the tracepoints that are available
to be used by various Linux tracing tools (e.g. ftrace, perf, uprobes,
etc.); it is meant to be a version of the tracefs filesystem that
dynamically allocates its entries as needed.  The goal is to reduce the memory
required for multiple instances of tracefs, as Steven Rostedt described in
a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/895111/">session</a> at the 2022
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  He returned to the 2024
edition of the summit to talk further about how to make pseudo (or virtual)
filesystems, such as tracefs/eventfs, more like regular Linux filesystems,
where the directory entries (dentries) and inodes are only created (and
cached) as needed.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[There are a number of kernel filesystems that store their directory entries
directly in the directory-entry cache (dcache) without having any permanent
storage for those objects. It started out as a "neat hack" for <a

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/980430/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/google/psp">
PSP security protocol</a> (PSP) is a way to transparently encrypt packets by
efficiently offloading encryption and decryption to the network
interface cards (NICs) that Google uses for connections inside its data centers. The
protocol is similar to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec">
IPsec</a>, in that it allows for wrapping arbitrary traffic
in a layer of encryption. The difference is that PSP is encapsulated in UDP, and
designed from the beginning to reduce the amount of state that NICs
have to track in order to send and receive encrypted traffic, allowing for more
simultaneous connections. Jakub Kicinski
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/netdev/20240510030435.120935-1-kuba@kernel.org/">
wants to add support</a> for the protocol to the Linux kernel.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979789/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="https://www.devconf.info/cz/">DevConf.cz 2024</a>,
Marta Lewandowska gave a talk to discuss a
new approach for booting Linux systems, "<a
href="https://pretalx.com/devconf-cz-2024/talk/W3AVCT/">No more boot
loader: Please use the kernel instead</a>". The talk, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywrSDLp926M">available on
YouTube</a>, introduced a new project called nmbl (for "no more bootloader",
pronounced "nimble"). The idea is to get rid of bootloaders (e.g., 
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GNU GRUB</a>) with a
<a
href="https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/unified_kernel_image/">Unified
Kernel Image</a> (UKI) that removes the need for a separate bootloader
altogether. It is early days for nmbl, currently the project is only
being tested for use with virtual machines, but the idea is
compelling. If successful, nmbl could offer security, performance, and
maintenance benefits compared to GRUB and other separate bootloaders.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979870/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
ISO releases new <span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++</span>
language standards on a three-year cadence; now that it's been
more than a year since the finalization of
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++23</span>, we have a good idea of what
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/26">
features could be adopted for
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++26</span></a> — although proposals can
still be submitted until January 2025. Of particular interest is the addition of
support for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_pointer">
hazard pointers</a> and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/573424/">
user-space read-copy-update</a> (RCU).
Even though <span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++26</span> is not yet a standard, many of the proposed features are already
available to experiment with in GCC or Clang.

            <description><![CDATA[Random numbers, it seems, can never be random enough, and they cannot be
generated quickly enough.  The kernel's <a

are relatively fast, but they are necessarily slower than calling a
function directly.  In an attempt to speed the provision of secure random

	There are a number of requirements to properly use the

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/979524/">
Redox</a> has <a href="https://www.redox-os.org/news/kernel-11/">received a
grant</a> to work on implementing POSIX-compatible signals. The
<a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/4lDO2/rfcs/-/blob/signals/text/0000-userspace-signals.md">
draft design</a> calls for them to be implemented nearly completely in user space.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
So far, the signals project has been going according to plan, and
hopefully, POSIX support for signals will be mostly complete by the
end of summer, with in-kernel improvements to process management.
After that, work on the userspace process manager will begin,
possibly including new kernel performance and/or functionality
improvements to facilitate this.

<p>The Foundation's Interim Executive Director, Richard Littauer,
brings years of open source leadership as part of his work as an
organizer of SustainOSS and CURIOSS, as a sustainability coordinator
at the Open Source Initiative, and as a community development manager
at Open Source Collective, and through open source contributions to
many projects, such as Node.js and IPFS. The Board appointed Richard
in June and is confident in his ability to guide the Foundation during
this transitional period.

            <title>An empirical study of Rust for Linux</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981635/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The research value of <a
href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc24/presentation/li-hongyu">this
USENIX paper</a> by Hongyu Li et al. is not entirely clear, but it does
show that the Rust-for-Linux project is gaining wider attention.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Despite more novice developers being attracted by Rust to the
	kernel community, we have found their commits are mainly for
	constructing Rust-relevant toolchains as well as Rust crates alone;
	they do not, however, take part in kernel code development. By
	contrast, 5 out of 6 investigated drivers (as seen in Table 5) are
	mainly contributed by authors from the Linux community. This
	implies a disconnection be- tween the young and the seasoned
	developers, and that the bar of kernel programming is not lowered
	by Rust language.
