            <title>Linux nftables vulnerability exploited in the wild (CrowdStrike)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/977583/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a
href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/active-exploitation-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation-vulnerability/">
According to CrowdStrike</a>, a
<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1086">
vulnerability</a> in the Linux kernel's nftables code
that was <a href="https://pwning.tech/nftables/"> discovered earlier this
year</a> is being actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability allows for
local privilege escalation. Most distributions have already released a fix.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
As noted by the exploit developer, leveraging this POC is dependent on the
kernel's unprivileged user namespaces feature accessing nf_tables. This access
is enabled by default on Debian, Ubuntu and kernel capture-the-flag (CTF)
distributions. An attacker can then trigger the double-free vulnerability, scan
the physical memory for the kernel base address, bypass kernel address-space
layout randomization (KASLR) and access the modprobe_path kernel variable with
read/write privileges. After overwriting the modprobe_path, the exploit drops a
root shell.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/974945/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Alan Jowett gave a remote presentation at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> about what features could be
added to LLVM to make writing BPF programs easier. While there is nothing specific
to LLVM about BPF code (and the next session in the track was led by GCC
developer José Marchesi about better support for that compiler), LLVM is currently the most
common way to turn C code into BPF bytecode. That translation, however, runs
into problems when the BPF verifier cannot understand the code LLVM's
optimizations produce.

            <description><![CDATA[Using huge pages has been known for years to improve the performance of
many workloads.  But traditional huge pages, often sized by the CPU at 2MB,
can be difficult to allocate and can waste memory due to internal
fragmentation.  Driven by both the folio transition and hardware
improvements, attention to smaller, multi-size transparent huge pages
(mTHPs) has been on the rise.  In two memory-management-track sessions at

David Vernet's second talk at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> was a summary of the state of
sched_ext, the extensible BPF scheduler that <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/972710/">LWN
covered a in early May</a>. In short, sched_ext is intended as a platform for
rapid experimentation with schedulers, and a tool to let performance-minded
administrators customize the scheduler to their workload. The patch set has seen
several revisions, becoming more generic and powerful over time.
Vernet spoke about what has been done in the past year,
and what is still missing before sched_ext can be considered pretty much
complete.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/974575/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Almost immediately after the merging of <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/603762/">control
groups</a>, kernel developers set their sights on reimplementing them
properly.  The second version of the control-group API started trickling
into the kernel around the 3.16 release in 2014 and users have long since
been encouraged to migrate, but support for (and users of) the initial API
remain.  At the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2024
Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit</a>,
memory-management developers discussed whether (and when) it might be
possible to remove the version-1 memory controller.  The session was led by
Shakeel Butt and (participating remotely) Roman Gushchin.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Drew DeVault has <a
href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-06-04-status-and-plans/">published</a>
an update about the state of the <a
href="https://sourcehut.org/">SourceHut</a> software development
platform and its plans for the coming months. This is the first update
since the January <a

following a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that resulted
in a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958125/">prolonged
outage</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>As you can imagine, it has been a stressful time for us. However, I
wish to stress that everything we've been dealing with is planned for
in our models, both technical and financial. There is no existential
threat to SourceHut. Nevertheless, we are grateful for your patience
and support.</p>

<p>[...] We have been focusing on two things this year: provisioning
and managing our infrastructure and getting as much rest as
possible. Our situation has calmed down, and while we still have a lot
of loose ends to attend to I'm happy to say that we're resuming a
sense of normalcy here and preparing to resume our work on the
features you need.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[In the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/975597/">recent discussion</a> on commenting at
LWN, several readers asked for the ability to hide subthreads of a long
comment stream.  That feature has just been added; it is also integrated
with the three comment-display modes and with comment filtering, removing
the need for JavaScript for filtering.  Hiding is not persistent; no extra
data is stored at either end.
<p>
Give it a try; if you have comments on the new mechanism, this is the place
to put them.]]></description>
