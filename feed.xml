            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1007689/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Jake Hillion gave
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4489-concurrency-testing-using-custom-linux-schedulers/">
a presentation</a> at
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/">
FOSDEM</a> about using
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/scheduler/sched-ext.html">
sched_ext</a>, the BPF
scheduling framework that was introduced in kernel version 6.12, to help find
elusive concurrency problems. In collaboration with Johannes Bechberger, he has
built a scheduler that can reveal theoretically possible but unobserved
concurrency bugs in test code in a few minutes. Since their scheduler only
relies on mainline kernel features, it can theoretically be applied to any
application that runs on Linux — although there are a number of caveats since
the project is still in its early days.

            <title>[$] An update on sealed system mappings</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006375/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Jeff Xu has been working on
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20241125202021.3684919-1-jeffxu@google.com/">
a patch set</a> that makes certain mappings in a process's address space
impossible to change, sealing them against tampering. This has some potential
security benefits — mainly, making
sure that someone cannot relocate the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/446528/">vsyscall and
vDSO mappings</a> — but some kernel developers haven't
been impressed with the patches.
While the core functionality (sealing the mappings) is sound, some of the
supporting code for enabling and disabling the new feature caused concern by
going against the normal design for such things. Reviewers also questioned
how this feature would interact with checkpointing and with sandboxing.

            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>, a free, general-purpose
programming language aimed at science, engineering, and related arenas of
technical computing, has steadily improved and widened its scope of
application since its <a
href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia">initial public
release in&nbsp;2012</a>. As part of its <a
href="https://julialang.org/blog/2024/10/julia-1.11-highlights/">1.11&nbsp;release</a> from late 2024, Julia made several inroads into areas
outside of its traditional focus, provided its users with advances in
tooling, and has seen several improvements in performance and programmer
convenience. 
These recent developments in and
around Julia go a long way to answer several longstanding complaints from
both new and experienced users. We last <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958337/">looked
in on the language</a> one year ago,
for its previous major release, Julia&nbsp;1.10.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006805/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[While the path toward the ability to write device drivers in Rust has been
anything but smooth, steady progress has been made and that goal is close
to being achieved — for some types of drivers at least.  Device drivers
need to be able to set up memory areas for direct memory access (DMA)
transfers, though; that means Rust drivers will need a set of
abstractions to interface with the kernel's DMA-mapping subsystem.  Those
abstractions have run into resistance that has the potential to block
progress on the Rust-for-Linux project as a whole.]]></description>
