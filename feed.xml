            <title>Schaller: Fedora Workstation development update â€“ AI edition</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978470/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Christian Schaller <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2024/06/14/fedora-workstation-development-update-artificial-intelligence-edition/">writes about</a> AI and GPU-related features that are in flight and planned for Fedora 41.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Milan Crha has been working together with Alan Day and Jakub Steiner to come up with a <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/merge_requests/2034">streamlined user experience in GNOME Software to let you install the binary NVIDIA driver and provide you with an integrated graphical user interface help to sign the kernel module</a> for use with secure boot. This is a bit different than what we for instance are doing in RHEL, where we are working with NVIDIA to provide pre-signed kernel modules, but that is a lot harder to do in Fedora due to the rapidly updating kernel versions and which most Fedora users appreciate as a big plus. So instead what we are for opting in Fedora is as I said to make it simple for you to self-sign the kernel module for use with secure boot. We are currently looking at when we can make this feature available, but no later than Fedora Workstation 41 for sure.

            <title>New Human Interface Guidelines for KDE</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978465/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>KDE developer Nate Graham has <a
href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/06/09/new-human-interface-guidelines/">announced</a>
a new set of <a href="https://develop.kde.org/hig/">KDE Human
Interface Guidelines</a> (HIG) for the <a
href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> project. Graham says that the goals
for the new HIGs were to reflect how KDE designs software today, make
the content 100% actionable, improve navigation, and to improve the
guidelines so people feel comfortable contributing:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Like any rewrite, there are bound to be rough edges and omissions
compared to the old version. Maybe I missed a piece of useful
information in the old HIG that had been buried somewhere but retained
some value. Maybe there's low-hanging fruit for improvement. Help out
by <a href="https://develop.kde.org/hig/#contributing">contributing</a>!

            <description><![CDATA[<a

Project Zero article</a> looks at the exploitation of a few Android driver
bugs in great detail.

	As it becomes more difficult to find 0-days in core Android,

            <title>[$] Measuring and improving buffered I/O</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/976856/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[There are two types of file I/O on Linux, buffered I/O, which goes through
the page cache, and direct I/O, which goes directly to the storage device.
The performance of buffered I/O was reported to be a lot worse than direct
I/O, especially for one specific test, in Luis Chamberlain's 
<a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/Zdkxfspq3urnrM6I@bombadil.infradead.org/">topic
proposal</a> for a session at the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.
The proposal resulted in a lengthy mailing-list discussion, 
which also came up in <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/974487/">Paul McKenney's RCU session</a> the next
day; Chamberlain led a 
combined storage and filesystem session to discuss those results with an
eye toward improving buffered I/O performance.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/976793/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Many years ago, the PostgreSQL project started holding regular <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/CommitFest">CommitFests</a> to
help tackle the work of reviewing and committing patches in a more
organized fashion. That has served the project well, but some in
the project are concerned that CommitFests are no longer meeting
the needs of PostgreSQL or its contributors. A lengthy discussion on the
pgsql-hackers mailing list turned up a number of complaints, a few
suggestions for improvement, but little consensus or momentum toward
a solution.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/976355/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt> flag is meant for kernel memory allocations that
should not cause a call into the filesystems to reclaim memory because there are
already locks held that can potentially cause a deadlock.  The "scoped
allocation" API is a better choice for filesystems to indicate that they
are holding a lock, so <tt>GFP_NOFS</tt> has <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/753078/">long been on the chopping block</a>, though
progress has been slow.  In a filesystem-track session at
the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>, Matthew Wilcox wanted to
discuss how to move kernel filesystems away from the flag with the eventual

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/976317/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Alan Jowett returned for a second remote presentation at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> to compare the performance of
different BPF runtimes. He showed the results of the MIT-licensed BPF
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/bpf_performance">
microbenchmark suite</a> he has been working on.
The benchmark suite does not yet provide a good direct comparison between all
platforms, so the results should be
taken with a grain of salt. They do
seem to indicate that there is some significant variation between
implementations, especially for different types of BPF maps.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/976071/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
There are few topics as arcane as memory models, so it was a pleasant surprise
when the double-length session on the BPF memory model at the
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> turned out to be
understandable. Paul McKenney led the session, although he was clear that the
work he was presenting was also due to Puranjay Mohan, who unfortunately could
not attend the summit.
BPF does not actually have a formalized memory model yet;
instead it has relied on a history of talks like this one and a general informal understanding.
Unfortunately, ignoring memory models does not make them go away, and this has
already caused at least one BPF-related bug on weakly-ordered architectures.
Figuring out what a formal memory model for BPF should define was the focus of
McKenney's talk.

            <description><![CDATA[The "pidfdfs" virtual filesystem was added to the 6.9 kernel release as a
way to export better information about running processes to user space.  It
replaced a previous implementation in a way that was, on its surface, fully
compatible while adding a number of new capabilities.  This transition,
which was intended to be entirely invisible to existing applications,
already <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/963749/">ran into trouble</a> in March, when a
misunderstanding with SELinux caused systems with pidfdfs to fail to boot
properly.  That problem was quickly fixed, but it turns out that there was
one more surprise in store, showing just how hard ABI compatibility can be
at times.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/975830/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
While BPF may be most famous for its use in the Linux kernel, there is actually
a growing effort to standardize BPF for use on other systems. These include
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/857215/">
eBPF for Windows</a>, but also
<a href="https://github.com/iovisor/ubpf">
uBPF</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/qmonnet/rbpf">
rBPF</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rprinz08/hBPF">
hBPF</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpftime">
bpftime</a>, and
others. Some hardware manufacturers are even
considering integrating BPF directly into networking hardware. Dave Thaler
led two sessions about all of the problems that cross-platform use inevitably
brings and the current status of the standardization work at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.

"<q>Leap 15.6 is projected to receive maintenance and security updates

release</q>".  Changes include the addition of the <a

6.4 kernel, GNOME&nbsp;45, and many other upgrades.  This release also
removes a long list of unmaintained Python packages.  See <a

            <title>Extensible scheduler class to be merged for 6.11</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978007/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/922405/">extensible scheduler class</a>
("sched_ext") framework allows the writing of CPU schedulers as a set of
BPF programs.  It has been <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/972710/">somewhat
controversial</a>, and its merging into the kernel has been blocked despite
a clear level of interest from users.

Linus Torvalds has now <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/CAHk-=wg8APE61e5Ddq5mwH55Eh0ZLDV4Tr+c6_gFS7g2AxnuHQ@mail.gmail.com">let
it be known</a> that he has made a decision and, overriding the scheduler
maintainer, will merge sched_ext for the 6.11 release.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	I honestly see no reason to delay this any more. This whole
	patchset was the major (private) discussion at last year's kernel
	maintainer summit, and I don't find any value in having the same
	discussion (whether off-list or as an actual event) at the upcoming
	maintainer summit one year later, so to make any kind of sane
	progress, my current plan is to merge this for 6.11.
