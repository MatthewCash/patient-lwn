covered in the first gathering include preparing 64-bit Arm kernels for

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/968600/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On April 3 security researcher Bartek Nowotarski
<a href="https://nowotarski.info/http2-continuation-flood-technical-details/">
published</a> the details of a new denial-of-service (DoS)
attack, called a "continuation flood", against many
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a>-capable web
servers. While the attack is not terribly complex, it affects many independent
implementations of the HTTP/2 protocol, even though multiple
similar vulnerabilities over the years have given implementers plenty of warning.

            <title>The &quot;branch history injection&quot; hardware vulnerability</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/969210/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The mainline kernel has just received a set of commits mitigating the
latest x86 hardware vulnerability, known as "branch history injection".
From <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7390db8aea0d">this commit</a>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Branch History Injection (BHI) attacks may allow a malicious
	application to influence indirect branch prediction in kernel by
	poisoning the branch history. eIBRS isolates indirect branch
	targets in ring0.  The BHB can still influence the choice of
	indirect branch predictor entry, and although branch predictor
	entries are isolated between modes when eIBRS is enabled, the BHB
	itself is not isolated between modes.
</blockquote>
<p>
See <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ec9404e40e8f">this commit</a> for
documentation on the command-line parameter that controls this mitigation.

            <title>Gentoo Linux becomes an SPI Associated Project</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/969373/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> project has <a
href="https://www.gentoo.org/news/2024/04/10/SPI-associated-project.html">announced</a>
that it is now an Associated Project of <a
href="https://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public Interest</a>
(SPI), which will allow it to accept tax deductible donations in the
US and reduce its "<q>non-technical workload</q>":</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The current Gentoo Foundation has bylaws restricting its behavior
to that of a non-profit, is a recognized non-profit only in New
Mexico, but a for-profit entity at the US federal level. A direct
conversion to a federally recognized non-profit would be unlikely to
succeed without significant effort and cost.</p>

<p>[...] SPI is already now recognized at US federal level as a
full-[fledged] non-profit 501(c)(3). It also handles several projects of
similar type and size (e.g., Arch and Debian) and as such has exactly
the experience and background that Gentoo needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the announcement, the goal is to "<q>eventually
transfer the existing assets to SPI and dissolve the Gentoo
Foundation</q>". How to do that is still under discussion. This will
not affect <a href="https://gentoo-ev.org/">Förderverein
Gentoo e.V.</a>, which  has public-benefit status in Germany and can
accept tax deductible donations in Europe.</p>]]></description>

            <title>What we need to take away from the XZ Backdoor (openSUSE News)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/969591/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Dirk Mueller has posted <a
href="https://news.opensuse.org/2024/04/12/learn-from-the-xz-backdoor/">a
lengthy analysis</a> of the XZ backdoor on the openSUSE News site, with a
focus on openSUSE's response.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Debian, as well as the other affected distributions like openSUSE
	are carrying a significant amount of downstream-only patches to
	essential open-source projects, like in this case OpenSSH. With
	hindsight, that should be another Heartbleed-level learning for the
	work of the distributions. These patches built the essential steps
	to embed the backdoor, and do not have the scrutiny that they
	likely would have received by the respective upstream
	maintainers. Whether you trust Linus Law or not, it was not even
	given a chance to chime in here. Upstream did not fail on the
	users, distributions failed on upstream and their users here.
