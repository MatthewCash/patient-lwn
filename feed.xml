	But it all looks fairly normal. rc4 is bigger than either rc2 or

	where it takes a while before people find some issues. So nothing

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/986030/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> project has
<a
href="https://www.gentoo.org/news/2024/08/14/Gentoo-drops-IA-64-support.html">announced</a>
that it is dropping support for Itanium:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Following the removal of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium">IA-64 (Itanium)</a>
support in the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cf8e8658100d4eae80ce9b21f7a81cb024dd5057">Linux kernel</a>

a <a href="https://projects.gentoo.org/council/meeting-logs/20240721-summary.txt">vote by the Gentoo Council</a>, Gentoo will discontinue all ia64
profiles and keywords. The primary reason for this decision is the
inability of the Gentoo IA-64 team to support this architecture
without kernel support, glibc support, and a functional development
box (or even a well-established emulator). In addition, there have
been only very few users interested in this type of hardware.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/984313/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The desire for the ability to checkpoint a process — to record its state in
a form that can be restarted at a future time — on Linux is almost as old as
Linux itself.  See, for example, <a
href="https://lwn.net/1998/0528/a/checkpoint.html">this announcement</a> of a checkpoint
project that appeared in LWN in 1998.  While working solutions exist, they
can be somewhat fragile and difficult to use; it is not surprising that
some people are interested in finding a better alternative.  A current
effort goes by the name CRIB,
for Checkpoint/Restore in (naturally) BPF.  It is far from clear that CRIB
will replace the existing solutions, but it is an interesting look at a
different way of solving the problem.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[There are lots of places in the kernel where an <tt>EINVAL</tt> can be
returned to user space, but it is often unclear what the actual underlying
problem is because the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html"><tt>errno</tt></a>
error codes are too generic.  That is the problem that Miklos Szeredi
wanted to discuss in a filesystem session that he led remotely at the 2024 <a

Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  He would like to help

            <description><![CDATA[David Howells wanted to discuss changing the way filesystem code handles
the ability to interrupt or kill operations, in order to fix some
longstanding problems with network 
(and other) filesystems, in a session at
the 2024 <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.   As noted in
his <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/2701318.1706863882%40warthog.procyon.org.uk/">session
proposal</a>, some filesystems may be expecting to not be interruptible,
but are calling code can take locks and mutexes that are interruptible (or
killable), which are effectively
changing the state of the task incorrectly.
He would like to find a solution for that problem.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/BUSL-1.1.html">Business
Source License</a> (BUSL) is a source-available license that "converts"
to an open-source license after a period of time. In theory, this
means that a few years after a version of a product is released under
the BUSL, it becomes open source and is fair game for Linux
distributions to package along with regular open-source projects. In
practice, the license throws a few curveballs that require special
consideration and caution, as the Fedora Project recently discussed.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983843/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
There is ongoing discussion about the ethics and effectiveness of
telemetry following some recent LWN articles that touched on
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/982610/">
Thunderbird's use of opt-out
telemetry</a> and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/980598/">planned metrics in Fedora</a>. The
<a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/">
Internet Security Research Group</a> (ISRG), the nonprofit behind
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">
Let's Encrypt</a>, has a potential solution to the problem of how to collect and
aggregate telemetry without violating users' privacy. The scheme is based on a
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ppm-dap/">draft
protocol</a> being standardized with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),
and has an
<a href="https://github.com/divviup/libprio-rs">open-source implementation</a>
available.

            <description><![CDATA[Like many projects written in C, the kernel makes extensive use of the C
preprocessor; indeed, the kernel's use is rather more extensive than most.
The preprocessor famously has a number of sharp edges associated with it.
One might not normally think of increased compilation time as one of them,
though.  It turns out that some changes to a couple of conceptually simple
preprocessor macros — <tt>min()</tt> and <tt>max()</tt> — led to some truly
pathological, but hidden, behavior where those macros were used.]]></description>
