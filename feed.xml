            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/993785/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Rust, like C, has its own memory model describing how concurrent access to the
same data by multiple threads can behave.
The Linux kernel, however, has its own
ideas. The
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/718628/">
Linux kernel memory model</a> (LKMM) is subtly different from both the
standard C memory model and Rust's model.
At Kangrejos, Boqun Feng gave a presentation about the
need to reconcile the memory models used by Rust and the kernel,
including a few potential avenues for doing so. While
no consensus was reached, it is an area of active discussion.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/993484/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Paul McKenney gave a presentation at Kangrejos this year that wasn't (directly)
related to Rust. Instead, he spoke about the work he has been doing in concert
with many other contributors on improving the handling of subtle concurrency
problems in C++.
Although he cautioned that his talk was only an overview, and not a
substitute for reading the relevant papers, he hoped that the things the C++
community is working on would be of interest to the Rust developers present as
well, and potentially inform future work on the language. McKenney's talk was,
as is his style, full of subtle examples of weird multithreaded behavior.

well-known either, Samuel Henrique said at the start of his <a

of software-engineering effort that has been put in place by the
distribution in order to create and maintain its releases, but "<q>loads of
people are not aware</q>" of it.  That may be due to the fact that all of
that is
not really documented anywhere in a central location that he can just point
someone to.  Recognizing that is what led him to give the talk;
hopefully it will be a "<q>first step toward</q>" helping solve the problem.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/993163/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
At Kangrejos, Gary Guo wanted to discuss three problems with the way
Rust and C code in the kernel interact: mismatched types, too many type casts,
and the overhead of helper functions. To fix the first two problems, Guo proposed
changing the way the kernel maps C types into Rust types. The last problem was a
bit trickier, but he has a clever workaround for that, based on tricking
the compiler into inlining the helper functions across language boundaries.

            <description><![CDATA[At the recently concluded Maintainers Summit, it was <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/991062/">generally agreed that the Rust experiment would
continue</a>, and that the path was clear for more Rust code to enter the
kernel.  But the high-level view taken at such gatherings cannot always
account for the difficult details that will inevitably arise as the Rust
work proceeds.  A recent discussion on the nouveau mailing list may have
escaped the notice of many, but it highlights some of the problems that
will have to be worked out as important functionality written in Rust heads
toward the mainline.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/995337/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Jakub Kadlčík <a
href="https://frostyx.cz/posts/copr-modularity-the-end-of-an-era">announced
on his blog</a> that Fedora's <a
href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/">Copr</a> build system will
be dropping support for building <a
href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/core-concepts/module-stream/">modules</a>
(groups of RPM packages that are built, installed, and shipped
together) soon:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
The Fedora Modularity project never really took off, and building
modules in Copr even less so. We've had only 14 builds in the last two
years. It's not feasible to maintain the code for so few
users. Modularity has also been <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/RetireModularity">retired
since Fedora 39</a> and will die with RHEL 9.
</blockquote>

<p>Modularity features in Copr are now deprecated, and it will not be
possible to submit new module builds after April&nbsp;2025. LWN <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/805180/">covered</a> some of the

            <title>Several Russian developers lose kernel maintainership status</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/995186/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Perhaps one of the more surprising changes in the 6.12-rc4 development
kernel was <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/6e90b675cf94">the removal
of several entries</a> from the kernel's <tt>MAINTAINERS</tt> file.  The <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/2024101835-tiptop-blip-09ed@gregkh/">patch</a>
performing the removal was sent (by Greg Kroah-Hartman) only to the
patches@lists.linux.dev mailing list; the change was included in <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/ZxUH2J0BL3FCV6Hr@kroah.com/">a char-misc drivers
pull request</a> with no particular mention.
<p>
The explanation for the removal is simply "<q>various compliance
requirements</q>".  Given that the developers involved all appear to be of
Russian origin, it is not too hard to imagine what sort of compliance is
involved here.  There has, however, been no public posting of the policy
that required the removal of these entries.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/995140/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://almalinux.org/">AlmaLinux project</a> has <a href="https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-10-22-introducing-almalinux-os-kitten/">introduced</a> a new edition called "Kitten",
which will serve as "<q>the direct upstream for AlmaLinux OS and is
the primary point for the AlmaLinux community to engage and influence
the future of AlmaLinux OS</q>". Not intended for production use, the
first release is based on CentOS&nbsp;Stream&nbsp;10 source, which
will eventually be the basis for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
10:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Because we anticipated many changes in 10, we wanted to get a head
start on building AlmaLinux OS 10. Earlier this year we started
setting up infrastructure and the build pipeline for AlmaLinux OS 10,
and started testing using CentOS Stream 10's code. Based on this
preparation work, we are excited to share that we have successfully
built a preview of AlmaLinux OS 10 that we are calling AlmaLinux OS
Kitten 10.
</blockquote>

<p>The first Kitten release previews a number of ways that AlmaLinux will
diverge from RHEL 10, including re-enabling frame pointers,
including Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments
(SPICE), and adding packages for Firefox and Thunderbird, which have
been dropped from CentOS&nbsp;Stream&nbsp;10 in favor of Flatpak versions. New
installation images for Kitten will be built quarterly. See the <a

            <title>A vulnerability in the Guix build system</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/994865/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The 
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">
Guix</a> project has
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2024/build-user-takeover-vulnerability/">
disclosed</a> a security vulnerability in the build daemon that the distribution uses to build and install software locally. The vulnerability allows an existing unprivileged user to get access to a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid">
setuid</a> binary, and from there potentially interfere with any other software built or installed on the computer. The project recommends upgrading the guix daemon now, to avoid the issue.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
This exploit requires the ability to start a derivation build and the
ability to run arbitrary code with access to the store in the root PID
namespace on the machine the build occurs on. As such, this represents
an increased risk primarily to multi-user systems and systems using
dedicated privilege-separation users for various daemons: without
special sandboxing measures, any process of theirs can take advantage
of this vulnerability.

"<q>I'm not happy with how big this is - it's probably far from the biggest
rc4 ever, but it _is_ the biggest rc4 we've had in the 6.x series at least
in number of commits.</q>"]]></description>
