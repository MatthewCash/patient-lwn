            <description><![CDATA[<p>The SUSE Security Team Blog has a <a href="https://security.opensuse.org/2024/09/18/pcp-network-audit.html">detailed review</a> of the <a

<blockquote class="bq">
The rather complex PCP software suite was difficult to judge just from
a cursory look, so we decided to take a closer look especially at
PCP's networking logic at a later time. This report contains two CVEs
and some non-CVE related findings we also gathered during the
follow-up review.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/991028/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The OpenSSH project has <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.9">released</a> version 9.9. This version includes support for the 
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/973231/">new post-quantum cryptography standard from NIST</a>.
The release also includes
the next step in the deprecation of DSA keys — they are now disabled by default at compile time,
and are expected to be removed entirely in early 2025. The release also contains the normal mixture of bug fixes and small usability improvements.

On September 19, Thomas Gleixner delivered the pull request for the
realtime preemption enablement patches to Linus Torvalds — in printed form,
wrapped in gold, with a ribbon, as Torvalds had requested.  It was a
significant milestone, marking the completion of a project that required
20&nbsp;years of effort.  Congratulations are due to everybody involved.
<p>
Torvalds <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/baeb9a7d8b60">acted on</a>
the pull request the following morning.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/988894/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Python community has been roiled, to a certain extent, by an <a
href="https://discuss.python.org/t/three-month-suspension-for-a-core-developer/60250">action
taken by
the steering council</a> (SC): the three-month suspension
of a unnamed—weirdly—Python core developer.  Tim Peters is the developer
in question, as he has <a

though it could easily be deduced from the SC message. Peters has been
involved in the
project from its early days and, among many other things, is the author of
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">PEP&nbsp;20</a> ("The Zen of
Python").  The suspension was due to violations of the project's <a
href="https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/">code of
conduct</a> that stem from the discussion around a somewhat controversial <a

            <description><![CDATA[CPU scheduling is a challenging job; since it inherently requires making
guesses about what the demands on the system will be in the future, it
remains reliant on heuristics, despite ongoing efforts to remove them.
Some of those heuristics take special note of tasks that are (or appear to
be) waiting for fast I/O operations.  There is some unhappiness, though,
with how this factor is used, leading to a couple of patches taking rather
different approaches to improve the situation.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/987319/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Code review is in high demand, and short supply, for most open-source projects.
Reviewer time is precious, so any tool that can lighten the load is worth exploring.
That is why Jesse Brandeburg and Kamel Ayari decided to test whether
tools like ChatGPT could review patches to provide quick feedback to
contributors about common problems. In <a
href="https://netdevconf.info/0x18/sessions/talk/ai-enhanced-reviews-for-linux-networking.html">a
talk</a> at the <a href="https://netdevconf.info/0x18/">Netdev
0x18</a> conference this July, Brandeburg provided an overview of an
experiment using machine learning to review emails containing patches
sent to the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.6/networking/netdev-FAQ.html">netdev</a>
mailing list. Large-language models (LLMs) will not be replacing human reviewers anytime
soon, but they may be a useful addition to help humans focus on deeper
reviews instead of simple rule violations.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/988401/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch">OpenSnitch</a> is an
"<q>interactive application firewall</q>". Like other firewalls, it uses a
series of rules to decide what network traffic should be permitted. Unlike
many other firewalls, though, OpenSnitch does not ask the user to create a list of rules
ahead of time. Instead, the list of rules can be built up
incrementally as applications make connections — and the user can peruse both
the rules that have built up over time, and statistics on the connections that
have been attempted.

            <title>Security proof for Linux&apos;s random number generator</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/990596/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Four researchers have <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1421.pdf">published</a> a formal proof that Linux's new deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) is secure in a particular sense — specifically, that the number of queries that would need to be made to it to uncover its internal state depends on the quality of the entropy it can collect from different sources. As long as it can gather enough entropy, it produces secure random numbers.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Since the significant structural changes in Linux 4 and Linux 5.17, there has
been no research on the provable security of Linux-DRBG. For the first time (to
the best of our knowledge), we formally model the Linux-DRBG in Linux 6.4.8
and prove its security in the seedless robustness model
</blockquote>

            <title>Linux Foundation announces OpenSearch Software Foundation</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/990517/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Linux Foundation has <a
href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-opensearch-software-foundation-to-foster-open-collaboration-in-search-and-analytics">announced</a>
the creation of the <a
href="https://foundation.opensearch.org/">OpenSearch Software
Foundation</a> as a vendor&#8209;neutral home for the <a
href="https://opensearch.org">OpenSearch</a> search and observability
software:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Established in 2021 and previously hosted by Amazon Web Services
(AWS), OpenSearch has recorded more than 700 million software
downloads and participation from thousands of contributors and more
than 200 project maintainers.
</blockquote>

<p>AWS <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-opensearch/">created</a>
the OpenSearch project as an open-source fork of ElasticSearch and
Kibana in 2021 after Elastic <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/843274/">moved those projects to
non-free licenses</a>. Elastic <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/987850/">announced</a> in August that it would
relicense the projects under the Affero GPL (AGPL).</p>]]></description>

            <title>Valkey 8.0.0 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/990490/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://valkey.io/blog/valkey-8-ga/">Version 8.0.0</a> of
the <a href="https://valkey.io">Valkey</a> open-source in-memory data
store is now available. This is the first major release of Valkey
since the project <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/966631/">forked</a> from <a
href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> in March of this year:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
While this is a major version, Valkey takes command set compatibility
seriously: Valkey 8.0.0 makes no backwards incompatible changes to the
existing command syntax or their responses. Your existing tools and
custom software will be able to immediately take advantage of Valkey
8.0.0. Since Valkey 8.0.0 does make some small changes to previously
undefined behaviors, it's wise to <a
href="https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/blob/8.0.0/00-RELEASENOTES">read
the release notes</a>. Additionally, because this version makes changes in how the
software uses threading, you may want to re-evaluate your cluster's
infrastructure to achieve the highest performance.
