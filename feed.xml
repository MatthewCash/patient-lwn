            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/976176/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://eco.kde.org/">KDE Eco</a>, a KDE project focused
on reducing software's environmental impact, has announced its <a
href="https://eco.kde.org/blog/2024-05-29_introducing-ns4nh/">Opt
Green</a> campaign to reduce e-waste:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Over the next two years, the "Opt Green" initiative will bring what
KDE Eco has been doing for <a href="https://community.kde.org/Goals/Sustainable_Software">sustainable software</a> directly to end
users. A particular target group for the project is those whose
consumer behavior is driven by principles related to the environment,
and not just price or convenience: the "eco-consumers".</p>

<p>Through online and offline campaigns as well as installation
workshops, we will demonstrate the power of Free Software to drive
down resource and energy consumption, and keep devices in use for the
lifespan of the hardware, not the software.</p>

<p>Our motto: <strong>The most environmentally-friendly device is the
one you already own.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the KDE Eco <a href="https://eco.kde.org/get-involved/">Get
Involved</a> page for more information on how to participate.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The term "memory model" is used in a couple of ways within the kernel.
Perhaps the more obscure meaning is the memory-management subsystem's view
of how physical memory is organized on a given system.  A proper
representation of physical memory will be more efficient in terms of memory
and CPU use.  Since hardware comes in numerous variations, the kernel
supports a number of memory models to match; see <a

            <description><![CDATA[For every page of memory in the system, the kernel maintains a set of page
flags describing how the page is used and various aspects of its current
state.  Space for page flags has been in <a

eliminate or consolidate them whenever possible.  That objective, though,
is hampered by the fact that the purpose of many page flags is not well

subsystem</a> was the first mechanism by which the kernel made huge pages
available to user space; it was added to the 2.5.46 development kernel in
2002.  While hugetlbfs remains useful, it is also viewed as a sort of
second memory-management subsystem that would be best unified with the rest
of the kernel.  At the <a

memory-allocation profiling work, which is meant to address this
shortcoming, at the 2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and

            <description><![CDATA[There are two fundamental levels of memory allocator in the Linux kernel:
the page allocator, which allocates memory in units of pages, and the slab
allocator, which allocates arbitrarily-sized chunks that are usually (but
not necessarily) smaller than a page.  The slab allocator is the one that
stands behind commonly used kernel functions like <tt>kmalloc()</tt>.  At

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/974102/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
David Vernet kicked off the BPF track at 2024's BPF track at the
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>
with a
talk about polymorphic kfuncs — or, with less jargon, kernel functions that can
be called from BPF which use different implementations depending on context.
He explained how this would be useful to
the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/972710/">sched_ext</a> BPF scheduling framework,
but expected it to be helpful in
other areas as well.

            <description><![CDATA[The term "memory tiering" refers to the management of memory placement on
systems with multiple types of memory, each of which has its own
performance characteristics.  On such systems, poor placement can lead to
significantly worse performance.  A memory-management-track discussion at

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/973964/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems are organized with their CPUs
grouped into nodes, each of which has memory attached to it.  All memory in
the system is accessible from all CPUs, but memory attached to the local
node is faster.  The kernel's <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html">memory-policy
("mempolicy") interface</a> allows threads to inform the kernel about how
they would like their memory placed to get the best performance.  In recent
years, the NUMA concept has been extended to support the management of
different types of memory in a system, pushing the limits of the mempolicy
subsystem.  In a remotely presented session at the <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">2024 Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>, Gregory Price discussed
the ways in which the kernel's memory-policy support should evolve to
handle today's more-complex systems.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Working on the Linux kernel has always been unlike working on
many other software projects.
One particularly noticeable difference is the decentralized nature of the
kernel's testing infrastructure. Projects such as
<a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller">
syzkaller</a>, <a href="https://foundation.kernelci.org/">KernelCI</a>,
or <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/608959/">the kernel self tests</a>
test the kernel in different ways. On February 28, Helen
Koike
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20240228225527.1052240-1-helen.koike@collabora.com/">
posted</a> a patch set that would add continuous integration (CI) scripts for
the whole kernel. The response was generally positive, but several people
suggested changes.

the <a
href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FreeBSD-2024_surv_web-_Final.pdf">2024
FreeBSD Community Survey Report</a>. The report provides a summary of
1,446 responses to an anonymous online survey of FreeBSD users. It
provides insights into user profiles, typical usage, how the FreeBSD
project is viewed, as well as recommendations for expanding the
FreeBSD community and contributor base:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Currently fewer than half of users consider FreeBSD their daily
driver; Individuals are less likely than Corporate Users to consider
FreeBSD primary. The barrier seems to be less about software and more
about hardware support, particularly around Wi-Fi drivers (which are
at the top of the wish list for the Foundation to focus on in the
coming year). A relatively high number of those who don't consider
FreeBSD their main OS say they would consider doing so with hardware
support for desktops and laptops that was equivalent to Linux.

            <description><![CDATA[When redesigning the LWN site in 2002, we thought long and hard about
whether the ability to post comments should be part of it; LWN had not
offered that feature for the first four years of its existence.  There were
already plenty of examples of how comments can go bad by then, but we
decided to trust our readers to keep things under control.  Much of the
time, that trust has proved justified, but there have been times where
things have not gone so well.  This time is quickly becoming one of those
others.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Geoff Huston <a
href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/dnssec-fin.html">suggests</a>
that it is time to give up on DNSSEC and look for a better way to secure
the Internet namespace.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	What appears to be very clear (to me at any rate!) is that DNSSEC
	as we know it today is just not going anywhere. It's too complex,
	too fragile and just too slow to use for the majority of services
	and their users. Some value its benefits highly enough that they
	are prepared to live with its shortcomings, but that's not the case
	for the overall majority of name holders and for the majority of
	users, and no amount of passionate exhortations about DNSSEC will
	change this.
