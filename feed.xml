            <title>Results from the 2024 FreeBSD Community Survey Report</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/975807/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation</a> has <a
href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/results-from-the-2024-freebsd-community-survey-report/">announced</a>
the <a
href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FreeBSD-2024_surv_web-_Final.pdf">2024
FreeBSD Community Survey Report</a>. The report provides a summary of
1,446 responses to an anonymous online survey of FreeBSD users. It
provides insights into user profiles, typical usage, how the FreeBSD
project is viewed, as well as recommendations for expanding the
FreeBSD community and contributor base:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Currently fewer than half of users consider FreeBSD their daily
driver; Individuals are less likely than Corporate Users to consider
FreeBSD primary. The barrier seems to be less about software and more
about hardware support, particularly around Wi-Fi drivers (which are
at the top of the wish list for the Foundation to focus on in the
coming year). A relatively high number of those who don't consider
FreeBSD their main OS say they would consider doing so with hardware
support for desktops and laptops that was equivalent to Linux.
</blockquote>

<p>The <a
href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_comsurv_rawdata.pdf">raw
data</a> for the survey is available as well.</p>

            <title>A plea for more thoughtful comments</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/975597/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[When redesigning the LWN site in 2002, we thought long and hard about
whether the ability to post comments should be part of it; LWN had not
offered that feature for the first four years of its existence.  There were
already plenty of examples of how comments can go bad by then, but we
decided to trust our readers to keep things under control.  Much of the
time, that trust has proved justified, but there have been times where
things have not gone so well.  This time is quickly becoming one of those
others.]]></description>

            <title>Huston: Calling Time on DNSSEC?</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/975454/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Geoff Huston <a
href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/dnssec-fin.html">suggests</a>
that it is time to give up on DNSSEC and look for a better way to secure
the Internet namespace.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	What appears to be very clear (to me at any rate!) is that DNSSEC
	as we know it today is just not going anywhere. It's too complex,
	too fragile and just too slow to use for the majority of services
	and their users. Some value its benefits highly enough that they
	are prepared to live with its shortcomings, but that's not the case
	for the overall majority of name holders and for the majority of
	users, and no amount of passionate exhortations about DNSSEC will
	change this.

            <title>BitKeeper, Linux, and licensing disputes: How Linus wrote Git in 14 days 
(Graphite blog)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/974914/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a
href="https://graphite.dev/blog/bitkeeper-linux-story-of-git-creation">This
Graphite blog post</a> retells the history of the BitKeeper fiasco and the
dawn of the Git era.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	When we think of history, we often romanticize it as being born of
	a sudden stroke of inspiration. But the creation of git shows the
	far harsher reality of invention: a slowly escalating disagreement
	over a license; the need for a scrappy backup solution to unblock
	work; and then continued polishing and iteration through years and
	years, led not by the inventor, but rather a community.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/971195/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Large language models (LLMs) have been the subject of much discussion and
scrutiny recently. Of particular interest to open-source enthusiasts are the
problems with running LLMs on one's own hardware — especially when doing so
requires NVIDIA's proprietary CUDA toolkit, which remains unavailable in many
environments.
Mozilla has developed
<a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile">llamafile</a> as a
potential solution to these problems. Llamafile can compile LLM weights
into portable, native executables for easy integration, archival, or
distribution. These executables can take advantage of supported GPUs when
present, but do not require them.

            <description><![CDATA[Maintainers of open-source projects sometimes have disagreements with
contributors over how contributions are reviewed, modified, merged, and
credited. A written policy describing how contributions are handled can
help maintainers set reasonable expectations for potential contributors.
In turn, that can make the maintainer's job easier because it can help
reduce a source of friction in the project.  A guide to help create this
kind of policy for a project has recently been developed.]]></description>

            <title>[$] Debian dismisses AI-contributions policy</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/972331/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In April, the Gentoo Linux project <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/970072/">banned</a> the use of
generative AI/ML tools due to copyright, ethical, and quality
concerns. This means contributors cannot use tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to
creating content for the distribution such as code, documentation,
bug reports, forum posts. A proposal for Debian to adopt a similar
policy revealed a distinct lack of love for those kinds of tools,
though it would also seem few contributors support
banning them outright. </p>]]></description>

            <title>[$] Another push for sched_ext</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/972710/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The extensible scheduler class (or "sched_ext") is a comprehensive
framework that enables the implementation of CPU schedulers as a set of BPF
programs that can be loaded at run time.  Despite having attracted a fair
amount of interest from the development community, sched_ext has run into
considerable opposition and seems far from acceptance into the mainline.
The posting by Tejun Heo of <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20240501151312.635565-1-tj@kernel.org/">a new
version of the sched_ext series</a> at the beginning of May has restarted
this long-running discussion, but it is not clear what the end result will
be.]]></description>
