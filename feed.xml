            <title>The people should own the town square (Mastodon Blog)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005007/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> project has <a
href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/01/the-people-should-own-the-town-square/">announced</a>
that founder Eugen Rochko will be transferring "<q>key Mastodon
ecosystem and platform components (including name and copyrights,
among other assets)</q>" to a new non-profit organization:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Practically Mastodon will remain headquartered in and operate from
Europe primarily. We will continue day-to-day operations through the
Mastodon GmbH for-profit entity, which will become wholly owned by the
new European not-for-profit entity. The Mastodon GmbH entity
automatically became a for-profit as a result of its charitable status
being <a
href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2024/04/mastodon-forms-new-u.s.-non-profit/#mastodons-non-profit-status-in-germany">stripped
away in Germany</a>. The existing US-based non-profit entity, the
501(c)(3), will continue to function as a fundraising hub.</p>

<p>[...] We are in the process of a phased transition. First we are
establishing a new legal home for Mastodon and transferring ownership
and stewardship. We are taking the time to select the appropriate
jurisdiction and structure in Europe. Then we will determine which
other (subsidiary) legal structures are needed to support operations
and sustainability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rochko has, naturally, also <a

about the transition</a> on Mastodon.social.</p>

            <title>IPU6 camera support status update</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005031/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hans de Goede has <a
href="https://hansdegoede.dreamwidth.org/29233.html">posted an
update</a> about his work to support IPU6 cameras on Fedora and
submitting fixes upstream.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The initial IPU6 camera support landed in Fedora 41 only works on a
limited set of laptops. The reason for this is that with MIPI cameras
every different sensor and glue-chip like IO-expanders needs to be
supported separately.</p>

<p>I have been working on making the camera work on more laptop
models. After receiving and sending many emails and blog post comments
about this I have started filing Fedora bugzilla issues on a per
sensor and/or laptop-model basis to be able to properly keep track of
all the work.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[We have just now received word of <a
href="https://lore.kernel.org/xenomai/87ikqnuiqb.fsf@xenomai.org/">the
passing of Paolo Mantegazza</a>, the driving force behind the <a
href="https://www.rtai.org/">Real Time Application Interface</a> project
and a key figure in the development of realtime Linux.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Paolo used to describe himself as a simple practitioner of software
	development, one of whose missions was to contribute a free
	real-time system his students could use, study and improve for
	their research work at the university, welcoming others to
	join. Many Linux users and businesses owe him a lot, because under
	his leadership, the RTAI project has always defended the freedom of
	developers to implement real-time systems, particularly at times
	when it was threatened. His fierce will for RTAI served the Xenomai
	project, as well as others.
</blockquote>
<p>
He will be missed.

            <title>Rust 1.84.0 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1004614/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/01/09/Rust-1.84.0.html">Version
1.84.0</a> of the Rust language has been released.  Changes include
improved version selection for dependencies in Cargo, the beginning of the
migration to a new trait solver, and some updated pointer-provenance APIs.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Most of the time, programmers do not need to worry much about
	provenance, and it is very clear how a pointer got
	derived. However, when casting pointers to integers and back, the
	provenance of the resulting pointer is underspecified. With this
	release, Rust is adding a set of APIs that can in many cases
	replace the use of integer-pointer-casts, and therefore avoid the
	ambiguities inherent to such casts. In particular, the pattern of
	using the lowest bits of an aligned pointer to store extra
	information can now be implemented without ever casting a pointer
	to an integer or back. This makes the code easier to reason about,
	easier to analyze for the compiler, and also benefits tools like
	Miri and architectures like CHERI that aim to detect and diagnose
	pointer misuse.

that AVM has released the full source and installation scripts for its
routers in response to a lawsuit, filed by Sebastian Steck, based on Lesser
GNU Public License rights.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Historically, lawsuits have focused on the copyrights licensed
	under GPL (or the GPL and LGPL together). Steck's lawsuit uniquely
	focused exclusively on users' rights under the LGPL. Steck's work
	showed that despite being a "Lesser" license than GPL, LGPLv2.1
	still guarantees users the right to repair, modify and reinstall
	modified versions of the software on their device. There is now no
	doubt that both GPL and LGPL mandate the device owner's ability to
	make changes to the software in the flash memory so those changes
	persist across reboots.

            <title>[$] Systemd takes steps toward a more secure boot process</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001730/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The systemd project has been working for some time on
<a href="https://0pointer.net/blog/brave-new-trusted-boot-world.html">
promoting</a>
<a href="https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/unified_kernel_image/">
unified kernel
images</a> (UKIs), a format that bundles a kernel, initial disk image, kernel command line, and
other associated data into a single file. The advantage of the format is the ability to
authenticate the entire collection with secure boot, which makes it easier for
end users to know that their operating system hasn't been tampered with. The
downside is the lack of flexibility and increase in disk usage, since all of the
things packaged in a UKI must be updated together. But the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1001657/">
recent systemd 257 release</a> (along with other changes to be covered in a
future article) includes some
major changes to the UKI format, and the rest of the boot process, that
partially mitigate those downsides. The release also includes improvements for
hardware-locked disk encryption, which may also help secure some computers.

href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1001657/">systemd v257</a> release brings a number of incremental
enhancements to various components and utilities for working with
Linux systems. This includes more support for <a href="https://varlink.org/">varlink</a>, automated
downloading of disk images at boot time, and a number of improvements
to the secure-boot process for unified kernel images (UKIs), which we
have covered in <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1001730/">a separate

            <title>[$] Tim Peters returns to the Python community</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1002340/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[In the past, suspensions of Python core developers have effectively been
permanent because the recipients of the punishment chose not to return.
Things have played out quite differently after Tim Peters was <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/988894/">suspended for three months</a> back in August;
Peters has been posting to the Python discussion forum since his suspension
ended in early November and, generally, getting back to work as usual.
That does not mean that he—or others in the community—have accepted the way
he was treated, but he has largely made his peace with it.  The incident is
still reverberating through the Python world, however.]]></description>

            <title>[$] Process creation in io_uring</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1002371/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Back in 2022, Josh Triplett <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/908268/">presented a
plan</a> to implement a "spawn new process" functionality in the io_uring
subsystem.  There was a fair amount of interest at the time, but developers
got distracted, and the work did not progress.  Now, Gabriel Krisman
Bertazi has returned with <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20241209234316.4132786-1-krisman@suse.de">a patch series</a>
updating and improving Triplett's work.  While interest in this
functionality remains, it may still take some time before it is ready for
merging into the mainline.]]></description>

            <title>[$] FESCo provenpackager sanction causes problems</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1002450/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Fedora Engineering Steering Council (FESCo) has made a series of
missteps in deciding to revoke a longtime Fedora contributor's <a
href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Provenpackager_policy/">provenpackager</a>
status. FESCo made the decision during a closed session, based on private
complaints. It then publicly announced its decision, including the
contributor's name, while only supplying a vague account of the
contributor's actions. This has left the Fedora community with more
questions than answers, and raised a number of complaints about the
transparency of FESCo's process. In addition, the sequence of events has
sparked discussions about package ownership, as well as when and how it's
appropriate to push changes to packages that a developer doesn't own.</p>]]></description>

            <title>2024: Year in Review (Tor Blog)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1004460/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a> has <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/2024-year-in-review/">published a
review</a> of major milestones from 2024, including <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-tails-join-forces/">merging with
the Tails project</a>, work to enable human-friendly <tt>.onion</tt>
addresses, and the launch of <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-webtunnel-evading-censorship-by-hiding-in-plain-sight/">WebTunnel</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
By mimicking common internet protocols, WebTunnel improves the
resilience of the Tor network in regions with heavy censorship. And
since its launch earlier this year, we've made sure to prioritize
small download sizes for more convenient distribution and simplified
the support of uTLS integration further mimicking the characteristics
of more widespread browsers. This makes Webtunnel safe for general
users because it helps conceal the fact that a tool like Tor is being
used.
