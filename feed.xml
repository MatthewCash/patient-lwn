href="https://people.kernel.org/gustavoars/how-to-use-the-new-counted_by-attribute-in-c-and-linux">describes
the path to safer flexible arrays in the kernel</a>, thanks to the

<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	There are a number of requirements to properly use the

	always contain at least as many elements as indicated by the

            <title>Redox to implement POSIX signals in user space</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982186/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/979524/">
Redox</a> has <a href="https://www.redox-os.org/news/kernel-11/">received a
grant</a> to work on implementing POSIX-compatible signals. The
<a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/4lDO2/rfcs/-/blob/signals/text/0000-userspace-signals.md">
draft design</a> calls for them to be implemented nearly completely in user space.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
So far, the signals project has been going according to plan, and
hopefully, POSIX support for signals will be mostly complete by the
end of summer, with in-kernel improvements to process management.
After that, work on the userspace process manager will begin,
possibly including new kernel performance and/or functionality
improvements to facilitate this.

            <title>The 6.10 kernel has been released</title>

            <description><![CDATA[Linus has
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/981966/">released
the 6.10 kernel</a>.
<P>
<blockquote class="bq">
	So the final week was perhaps not quote as quiet as the preceding
	ones, which I don't love - but it also wasn't noisy enough to
	warrant an extra rc.

<p>

Changes in 6.10 include
the removal of support for some ancient Alpha CPUs,
shadow-stack support for the <a

Rust-language support on RISC-V systems,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/961884/">support</a> for some Windows NT synchronization
primitives (though it is marked "broken" in 6.10),
the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958438/"><tt>mseal()</tt> system call</a>,
<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/fsverity.html">fsverity</a>
support in the FUSE filesystem subsystem,

            <title>GNOME Foundation Announces Transition of Executive Director</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981850/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/">GNOME Foundation</a> has <a
href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2024/07/12/gnome-foundation-announces-transition-of-executive-director/">announced</a>
that executive director Holly Million is stepping down at the end of
July, and will be replaced by Richard Littauer as interim executive
director:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>On behalf of the whole GNOME community, the Board of Directors
would like to give our utmost thanks to Holly for her achievements
during the past 10 months, including drafting a bold five-year
strategic plan for the Foundation, securing two important fiscal
sponsorship agreements with GIMP and Black Python Devs, writing our
first funding proposal that will now enable the Foundation to apply
for more grants, vastly improving our financial operations, and
implementing a break-even budget to preserve our financial
reserves.</p>

<p>The Foundation's Interim Executive Director, Richard Littauer,
brings years of open source leadership as part of his work as an
organizer of SustainOSS and CURIOSS, as a sustainability coordinator
at the Open Source Initiative, and as a community development manager
at Open Source Collective, and through open source contributions to
many projects, such as Node.js and IPFS. The Board appointed Richard
in June and is confident in his ability to guide the Foundation during
this transitional period.
</blockquote>

<p>Million says she is leaving to pursue a PhD in psychology. The
board plans to announce its search plan for a permanent executive
directory after <a
href="https://events.gnome.org/event/209/">GUADEC</a>, which takes
place July 19 through 24.</p>

            <title>An empirical study of Rust for Linux</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981635/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The research value of <a
href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc24/presentation/li-hongyu">this
USENIX paper</a> by Hongyu Li et al. is not entirely clear, but it does
show that the Rust-for-Linux project is gaining wider attention.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Despite more novice developers being attracted by Rust to the
	kernel community, we have found their commits are mainly for
	constructing Rust-relevant toolchains as well as Rust crates alone;
	they do not, however, take part in kernel code development. By
	contrast, 5 out of 6 investigated drivers (as seen in Table 5) are
	mainly contributed by authors from the Linux community. This
	implies a disconnection be- tween the young and the seasoned
	developers, and that the bar of kernel programming is not lowered
	by Rust language.

            <title>[$] Eliminating indirect calls for security modules</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979683/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Like many kernel subsystems, the Linux security module (LSM) subsystem
makes extensive use of indirect function calls.  Those calls, however, are
increasingly problematic, and the pressure to remove them has been growing. 
The good news is that there is <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240629084331.3807368-1-kpsingh@kernel.org">a patch
series</a> from KP Singh that accomplishes that goal.  Its progress into
the mainline has been slow — this change was first <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-security-module/20200820164753.3256899-1-jackmanb@chromium.org/">proposed</a>
by Brendan Jackman and Paul Renauld in 2020 — and this work has been caught
up in some wider controversies along the way, but it should be close to
being ready.]]></description>

            <title>[$] Arithmetic overflow mitigation in the kernel</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979747/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On May 7, Kees Cook sent
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/202404291502.612E0A10@keescook/">
a proposal</a> to the linux-kernel mailing list, asking for the kernel
developers to start
working on a way to mitigate unintentional arithmetic overflow, which has been a
source of many bugs. This is not the first time Cook has made a request along
these lines; he <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/959189/">sent a related patch set</a> in
January 2024.
Several core developers objected to the plan for different
reasons. After receiving their feedback,
Cook modified his approach to tackle the problem
in a series of smaller steps.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979524/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
With the
<a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">
Rust-for-Linux</a> project starting to gain some ground, it is worth
looking at other operating systems that use Rust in their kernels. There
are <a href="https://github.com/flosse/rust-os-comparison">
many</a> attempts to use
Rust for operating system development, but <a href="https://redox-os.org/">Redox</a>
may be the most complete.
Redox is an MIT-licensed microkernel and corresponding user space, designed
around concepts taken from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs">
Plan 9</a>. While nowhere near being usable as a
replacement for Linux, it already provides a graphical user interface and
<a href="https://www.redox-os.org/faq/#what-programs-can-redox-run">
the ability to run many POSIX programs</a>.

revision</a>, this series appears to be stabilizing.  Device memory TCP is
a specialized networking feature requiring a certain amount of setup, but
it could provide a significant performance improvement for some
data-intensive applications.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>An upgrade from Python 3.11 to 3.12 has led to the rejection of
some Python apps by Apple's app stores. That led to Eric Froemling submitting a <a
href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120522">bug report</a>
against CPython. That, in turn, led to an interesting
discussion among Python developers about how far the project was
willing to go to accommodate app store review processes. Developers
reached a quick consensus, and a solution that may arrive as soon as
Python&nbsp;3.13.</p>]]></description>
