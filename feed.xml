            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/977762/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>CentOS Linux&nbsp;7 was <a
href="https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2014-July/020393.html">first
released</a> in July&nbsp;2014, and is due to go end-of-life (EOL) on June&nbsp;30.
By now, anyone who pays attention to such things is aware that Red Hat <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/839257/">pulled the plug</a> on
CentOS&nbsp;Linux in late&nbsp;2020 to be replaced by CentOS Stream
instead. CentOS&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;8
support was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/862832/">wound
down</a> at the end of 2021 rather than in 2029 as originally stated.
CentOS Linux&nbsp;7 was allowed to serve out its
full lifespan&mdash;but that EOL is approaching rapidly and
there's no direct upgrade path. Users and organizations looking for a lifeline might want to consider
AlmaLinux's <a href="https://wiki.almalinux.org/elevate/">ELevate</a>
utility, which allows CentOS users to migrate to alternate enterprise
Linux (EL) operating systems.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978010/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958438/"><tt>mseal()</tt> system call</a> allows a
process to prevent any future changes to portions of its address space
(thus "sealing" them); it was patterned after the <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/915640/"><tt>mimmutable()</tt> system call</a> in OpenBSD.
<tt>mseal()</tt> generated a lot of discussion, but it was finally merged
for the upcoming 6.10 kernel release.  While <tt>mseal()</tt> was initially
aimed at securing the Chrome browser, the hope was that it would be useful
elsewhere; as a step toward realizing that hope, Adhemerval Zanella has
posted <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240611153220.165430-1-adhemerval.zanella@linaro.org">a
patch series</a> adding support for — and use of — <tt>mseal()</tt> to the
GNU C library (glibc).]]></description>

            <title>[$] Securing BPF programs before and after verification</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/977394/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
BPF is in a unique position in terms of security. It runs in a privileged
context, within the kernel, and can have access to many sensitive details of the
kernel's operation. At the same time, unlike kernel modules, BPF programs aren't signed.
Additionally, the mechanisms behind BPF present challenges to implementing
signing or other security features. Three nearly back-to-back sessions at the
2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>
addressed some of the potential security problems.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/977486/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[VFS maintainer Christian Brauner led a discussion about the possibility of
selectively dropping the contents of the page cache for a filesystem in a
session at the
2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  As he described in his
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240116-tagelang-zugnummer-349edd1b5792%40brauner/">topic
proposal</a>, the use case that started him down this path comes from
GNOME, which wants to be able to safely suspend access to an encrypted home
directory.  While it is known to kernel
developers, it is surprising to others that reads from encrypted
filesystems that have been suspended will succeed if the data to be read
still exists in the 
page cache.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://opennetworking.org/p4/">P4</a>, short for "Programming
Protocol-independent Packet Processors", is a programming language aimed at
networking devices; it is useful for the configuration of firewalls and
complicated routing architectures.  Since a lot of advanced networking is
done with Linux systems, it stands to reason that there would be value in
supporting P4 and, indeed, <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/netdev/20230124170346.316866-1-jhs@mojatatu.com/">an
implementation of P4</a> in the kernel's traffic-control subsystem was
first posted by Jamal Hadi Salim at the beginning of 2023.  After nearly
18&nbsp;months, though, this feature has not been merged, and the chances
of that happening would appear to be getting worse.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://ladybird.dev/">Ladybird</a> is an open-source
project aimed at building an independent web browser, rather than
yet another browser based on Chrome. It is written in C++ and licensed under a
two-clause BSD license. The effort 
began as part of the <a href="https://www.serenityos.org/">SerenityOS</a> project, but
developer Andreas Kling <a

on June&nbsp;3 that he was "forking" Ladybird as a separate project and stepping away from
SerenityOS to focus his attention on the browser completely. Ladybird
is not ready to replace Firefox or Chrome for regular use, but it is showing
great promise.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/977013/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
BPF was first
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/599755/">
generalized beyond packet filtering</a> more than a decade ago. In that time, it
has changed a lot, becoming much more capable.
Alexei Starovoitov kicked off the second day of the BPF track at the 2024
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> by leading a session
discussing which changes to BPF are going to come in the next ten years as it
continues evolving. He proposed several ideas, including expanding the number of
registers available to BPF programs, dynamic deadlock detection, and relaxing
some existing limits of the verifier.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/976836/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The kernel's user-space ABI does not lack for ring buffers; they have been
defined for subsystems like <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/6.6/bpf/ringbuf.html">BPF</a>, <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/776703/">io_uring</a>, <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/userspace-api/perf_ring_buffer.html">perf</a>,
and <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/trace/ring-buffer-map.html">tracing</a>, for
example.  Naturally, each of those ring buffers is unique, with no common
interface between them.  The natural response to this ABI proliferation is,
of course, to add yet another ring buffer as the generic option; that is
the intent of <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20240603003306.2030491-1-kent.overstreet@linux.dev">this
patch series</a> from Kent Overstreet adding a new set of system calls for

            <description><![CDATA[The Python Software Foundation has published <a
href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/python-language-summit-2024.html">a
set of reports</a> from the 2024 Python Language summit.  Topics covered
include version numbering, the limited C API, a new default read-eval-print
loop, and Python's security model in light of the XZ backdoor:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	For multiple reasons like being able to fix bugs and
	single-maintainer modules, CPython doesn't require reviewers on the
	pull requests of core developers. This can lead to "unilateral
	action", meaning that a change is introduced into CPython without
	the review of someone besides the author. Other situations like
	release managers backporting fixes to other branches without review
	are common.

            <title>Schaller: Fedora Workstation development update – AI edition</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978470/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Christian Schaller <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2024/06/14/fedora-workstation-development-update-artificial-intelligence-edition/">writes about</a> AI and GPU-related features that are in flight and planned for Fedora 41.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Milan Crha has been working together with Alan Day and Jakub Steiner to come up with a <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/merge_requests/2034">streamlined user experience in GNOME Software to let you install the binary NVIDIA driver and provide you with an integrated graphical user interface help to sign the kernel module</a> for use with secure boot. This is a bit different than what we for instance are doing in RHEL, where we are working with NVIDIA to provide pre-signed kernel modules, but that is a lot harder to do in Fedora due to the rapidly updating kernel versions and which most Fedora users appreciate as a big plus. So instead what we are for opting in Fedora is as I said to make it simple for you to self-sign the kernel module for use with secure boot. We are currently looking at when we can make this feature available, but no later than Fedora Workstation 41 for sure.

            <title>New Human Interface Guidelines for KDE</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978465/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>KDE developer Nate Graham has <a
href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/06/09/new-human-interface-guidelines/">announced</a>
a new set of <a href="https://develop.kde.org/hig/">KDE Human
Interface Guidelines</a> (HIG) for the <a
href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> project. Graham says that the goals
for the new HIGs were to reflect how KDE designs software today, make
the content 100% actionable, improve navigation, and to improve the
guidelines so people feel comfortable contributing:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Like any rewrite, there are bound to be rough edges and omissions
compared to the old version. Maybe I missed a piece of useful
information in the old HIG that had been buried somewhere but retained
some value. Maybe there's low-hanging fruit for improvement. Help out
by <a href="https://develop.kde.org/hig/#contributing">contributing</a>!

            <title>Driving forward in Android drivers (Project Zero)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978441/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a
href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2024/06/driving-forward-in-android-drivers.html">This
Project Zero article</a> looks at the exploitation of a few Android driver
bugs in great detail.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	As it becomes more difficult to find 0-days in core Android,
	third-party Linux kernel drivers continue to become a more and more
	attractive target for attackers. While the bulk of present-day
	detected ITW [in-the-wild] Android exploitation targets GPU
	drivers, it's equally important that other third-party drivers are
	encouraged towards the same security standards.
