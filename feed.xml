            <title>[$] Offline applications with Earthstar</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005639/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://earthstar-project.org/">
Earthstar</a> is a privacy-oriented,
offline-first, LGPL-licensed database intended to support distributed
applications. Unlike other distributed storage libraries, it
focuses on providing mutable data with human-meaningful names and modification
times, which gives it an interface similar to many non-distributed
key-value databases.
Now, the developers are looking at switching to a new synchronization
protocol â€” one that is general enough that it might see wider adoption.

            <title>[$] FOSDEM keynote causes concerns</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006351/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This year's edition of the <a href="https://fosdem.org/">Free and Open
Source Software Developers' European Meeting</a> (FOSDEM) begins on
February&nbsp;1 in Brussels. The event is widely regarded as one of
the most important open-source conferences. One of the reasons that
FOSDEM is held in high esteem by the community is its non-commercial
nature. It does accept <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2025/about/sponsors/">sponsors</a>, but
sponsorships come with few perks and no "pay-for-play" speaking
slots. Thus, the scheduling of a keynote by Jack
Dorsey&#8288;&mdash;&#8288;primarily known for his role in co-founding Twitter, and
currently CEO and chairman of FOSDEM sponsor <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block%2C_Inc.">Block,&nbsp;Inc.</a>&#8288;&mdash;&#8288;raised eyebrows and led to plans for a protest. The
keynote has since been removed from the schedule, but there are still
a number of lingering questions.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Vendoring Go packages by default in Fedora</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005655/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://go.dev">Go language</a> is designed to make it
easy for developers to <a
href="https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started#call">import other
Go packages</a> and compile everything into a static binary
for simple distribution. Unfortunately, this complicates things for
those who package Go programs for Linux distributions, such as Fedora,
that have guidelines which require dependencies to be packaged
separately. Fedora's <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Go">Go special interest
group</a> (SIG) is asking for relief and a loosening of the bundling
guidelines to allow Go packagers to bundle dependencies into the
packages that need them, otherwise known as vendoring. So far, the
participants in the discussion have seemed largely in favor of the
idea.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Last year, LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958792/">examined</a> the changes lined up for
Rust's 2024 edition. Now, with the edition
<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/01/22/rust-2024-beta.html">
ready to be stabilized</a> in February,
it's time to look back at the edition process and see what was
successfully adopted, which new changes were added, and what still remains to
work on. A surprising amount of new work was proposed, implemented, and
stabilized during the year.

            <title>The trouble with the new uretprobes</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005662/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[A "uretprobe" is a dynamic, user-space tracepoint injected by the kernel
into a running process; <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/trace/uprobetracer.html">this document</a>
tersely describes their use.  Among other things, uretprobes are used by
the <tt>perf</tt> utility to time function calls.  The 6.11 kernel saw a
significant change to uretprobes that improved their performance, but that
change is also creating trouble for some users.  The best way to solve the
problem is not entirely clear.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005651/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[As of this writing, just over 4,300 non-merge changesets have been pulled
into the mainline repository for the 6.14 release.  Many of the pull
requests this time around include remarks saying that activity has been
relatively low this time around, presumably due to the holidays.  So those
4,300 changesets are probably closer to the merge-window halfway point than
usual.  Much of the work merged thus far looks more like incremental
improvements than major new initiatives, but there still have been a number
of interesting changes in the mix.]]></description>

active development: WebGPU, Shadow DOM, ReadableStream, WebXR, ... Servo
now supports two new platforms: Android and OpenHarmony. And we have

            <title>Whatâ€™s new in GTK, winter 2025 edition</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1007677/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Matthias Clasen has written a short update on a GTK hackfest that
took place at <a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDSEM</a> and what's
coming in GTK 4.18. This includes fixes for pointer sizes in Wayland
when fractional scaling is enabled, removal of the old GL renderer in
favor of the <a
href="https://blog.gtk.org/2024/01/28/new-renderers-for-gtk/">GL
renderer</a> introduced in <a
href="https://download.gnome.org/sources/gtk/4.13/gtk-4.13.6.news">GTK
4.13.6</a>, and deprecation of X11 and Broadway backends with intent
to remove them in GTK 5.</p>

<p>The deprecated backends will remain available until then, and no
action is required by developers at this time, Clasen wrote: "<q>There
is no need to act on deprecations until you are actively porting your
app to the next major version of GTK, which is not on the horizon
yet</q>".</p>

            <title>The Linux Foundation on global regulations and sanctions</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1007272/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Linux Foundation has published <a
href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/navigating-global-regulations-and-open-source-us-ofac-sanctions">its
long-awaited article on international sanctions</a> and open-source
development.  This is the reasoning that went into <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/995186/">the removal of a group of Russian kernel
maintainers</a> in October.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	It is disappointing that the open source community cannot operate
	independently of international sanctions programs, but these
	sanctions are the law of each country and are not optional. Many
	developers work on open source projects in their spare time, or for
	fun. Dealing with U.S. and international sanctions was unlikely on
	the list of things that most (or very likely any) open source
	developers thought they were signing up for. We hope that in time
	relevant authorities will clarify that open source and standards
	activities may continue unabated. Until that time, however, with
	the direct and indirect sponsorship of developers by companies, the
	intersection of sanctions on corporate entities leaves us in a
	place where we cannot ignore the potential risks.

            <title>Freedesktop looking for new home for its GitLab instance</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1007032/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Visitors to the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/">freedesktop.org</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/">GitLab instance</a> are currently being greeted with a message noting that
the company who has been hosting it for free for nearly five years, Equinix, has
asked that it be moved (or start being paid for) by the end of April.  The
<a
href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freedesktop/freedesktop/-/issues/2011">issue
ticket</a> opened by Benjamin Tissoires in order to  track the planning of a move is clear that the project is grateful for
the gift:
"<q>First, I'd like to thank Equinix Metal for the years of support they gave us. They were very kind and generous with us and even if it's a shame we have to move out on a short notice, all things come to an end.</q>"

<p>
The current cost for the services, much of which is for 50TB of bandwidth
per month and a half-dozen beefy servers for running continuous-integration
(CI) jobs, comes to around $24,000 per month.  Tissoires believes that the
project should start paying for service somewhere, in order to avoid
upheaval of this sort, sometimes on short or no notice. "<q>I personally
think we better have fd.o pay for its own servers, and then have sponsors
chip in. This way, when a sponsor goes away, it's technically much simpler
to just replace the money than change datacenter.</q>"  Various options are
being discussed there, but any move is likely to disrupt normal services
for a week or more.]]></description>

            <title>Thunderbird moving to monthly updates in March</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006917/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">Thunderbird</a> project has <a
href="https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/planning/Td58a7d8581e7d60f">announced</a>
that it is making its <a
href="https://developer.thunderbird.net/releases/channels">Release
channel</a> the default download beginning with the 135.0 release in
March. This will move users to major monthly releases instead of the
annual major Extended Support Release (ESR) that is the current
default.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
One of our goals for 2025 is to increase active installations on the
release channel to at least 20% of the total installations. At last
check, we had 29,543 active installations on the release channel,
compared to 20,918 on beta, and 5,941 on daily. The release channel
installations currently account for 0.27% of the 10,784,551 total
active installations tracked on stats.thunderbird.net.
