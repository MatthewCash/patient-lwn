            <title>OpenSSL announces new governance structure</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983120/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>OpenSSL has <a
href="https://openssl-library.org/post/2024-07-24-openssl-new-governance-structure/">announced</a>
that it has adopted a new governance framework:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The OpenSSL Management Committee (OMC) has been dissolved, and two
boards of directors have been elected for the <a
href="https://openssl-foundation.org/">Foundation</a> and the <a
href="https://openssl-corporation.org/">Corporation</a>. Each
organization has ten voting members. These boards share all the
responsibilities and authorities of the former OMC co-equally.</p>

<p>To further engage our communities, we are establishing two advisory
committees for each entity: a Business Advisory Committee (BAC) and a
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). The communities will elect the
members of the BACs and TACs, creating a direct channel for community
input in roadmap development and reflecting the diverse perspectives
of OpenSSL's communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OpenSSL has also announced that two projects have adopted the <a
href="https://openssl-mission.org/faq/index.html">OpenSSL Mission</a>
and become <a href="https://openssl-projects.org/">OpenSSL
projects</a>: <a
href="https://www.bouncycastle.org/">Bouncy Castle</a>, which provides
cryptographic APIs for Java and C#, and the <a
href="https://cryptlib.com/">cryptlib</a> security
software development toolkit. See the announcement for full details.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Let&apos;s Encrypt plans to drop support for OCSP.</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982965/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Let's Encrypt has
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/07/23/replacing-ocsp-with-crls.html">announced</a>
that it intends to end support "<q>as soon as possible</q>" for the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">
Online Certificate Status Protocol</a> (OCSP) over privacy concerns. OCSP was developed as a
lighter-weight alternative to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">
Certificate Revocation Lists</a> (CRLs) that did not involve downloading
the entire CRL in order to check whether a certificate was valid. Let's Encrypt will continue
supporting OCSP as long as it is a requirement for Microsoft's
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/program-requirements">
Trusted Root Program</a>, but hopes to discontinue it soon:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
We plan to end support for OCSP primarily because it represents a considerable risk to privacy on the Internet. When someone visits a website using a browser or other software that checks for certificate revocation via OCSP, the Certificate Authority (CA) operating the OCSP responder immediately becomes aware of which website is being visited from that visitor's particular IP address. Even when a CA intentionally does not retain this information, as is the case with Let's Encrypt, CAs could be legally compelled to collect it. CRLs do not have this issue.
</blockquote>

<p>
People using Let's Encrypt as their CA should, for the most part, not need to change their setups.
All modern browsers support CRLs, so end-users shouldn't notice an impact either.

            <title>Improvements to the PSF Grants program</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982967/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Python Software Foundation (PSF) board has <a
href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/07/psf-board-update-on-improvements-to-psf.html">announced</a>
improvements to its grants program that have been enacted as a
response to "<q>concerns and frustrations</q>" with the program:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
The PSF Board takes the <a href="https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-python-software_5.html">open letter</a> from the pan-African delegation
seriously, and we began to draft a plan to address everything in the
letter. We also set up improved two-way communications so that we can
continue the conversation with the community. The writers of the open
letter have now met several times with members of the PSF board. We
are thankful for their insight and guidance on how we can work
together and be thoroughly and consistently supportive of the
pan-African Python community.
</blockquote>

<p>So far the PSF has set up <a
href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/03/djangocon-africa-grant-process.html">office
hours</a> to improve communications, <a
href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/03/djangocon-africa-grant-process.html">published
a retrospective</a> on the DjangoCon Africa review, and put out a <a
href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/05/psf-grants-program-2022-2023.html">transparency
report</a> on grants from the past two years. The PSF board has also
voted to "<q>use the same criteria for all grant requests, no matter
their country of origin</q>".</p>]]></description>

            <title>Zuckerberg: Open Source AI Is the Path Forward</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982954/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Mark Zuckerberg has <a
href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/">posted
an article</a> announcing some new releases of the Llama large language
model and going on at length about why open-source models are important:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	AI has more potential than any other modern technology to increase
	human productivity, creativity, and quality of life – and to
	accelerate economic growth while unlocking progress in medical and
	scientific research. Open source will ensure that more people
	around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of
	AI, that power isn't concentrated in the hands of a small number of
	companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and
	safely across society.
<p>
	There is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI
	models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the
	alternatives. I think governments will conclude it's in their
	interest to support open source because it will make the world more
	prosperous and safer.
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, whether Llama is truly open source is debatable at best, but it
is more open than many of the alternatives.]]></description>

            <title>NGI project may lose funding</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982585/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">Next Generation Internet</a>
(NGI) project, an initiative of the EU's European Commission (EC),
provides funding in the form of grants for a wide variety of
open-source software,
including
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/982186/">Redox</a>,
<a href="https://briarproject.org/">Briar</a>,
<a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-07-18-ngi-must-be-renewed/">SourceHut</a>, and many more.
But the NGI project is not among those that would be funded under the current draft budget for 2025,
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/17/foss_funding_vanishes_from_eus/">
as The Register reports</a>. More than 60 organizations have signed on to <a
href="https://pad.public.cat/lettre-NCP-NGI#">an open letter</a> asking the
EC to reconsider:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free software as a whole, from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This ecosystem diversity backs the strength of European technological innovation, and maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural support to software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation is key to enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure.
Contrary to common perception, technical innovations often originate from European rather than North American programming communities, and are mostly initiated by small-scaled organizations.

            <title>Evolving the ASF Brand (Apache Software Foundation blog)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982392/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> (ASF)
has <a
href="https://news.apache.org/foundation/entry/evolving-the-asf-brand">announced</a>
that it will be changing its logo to remove the feather that has been part
of its brand since 1997.  ASF members will have input on the rebranding process and be
able to vote on the new logo, which will be unveiled at the <a href="https://communityovercode.org/">Community Over Code</a> conference in October.

<blockquote class="bq">
The feather is a well-loved and iconic part of the ASF brand. We know of community members who have ASF feather tattoos. People love taking photos with the feather at our flagship event each year. 
<p>
So why would we change it? As a non-Indigenous entity, we acknowledge that it is inappropriate for the Foundation to use Indigenous themes or language. We thank <a href="https://blog.nativesintech.org/apache-appropriation/">Natives in Tech</a> and other members of the broader open source community for bringing this issue to the forefront. Today we are announcing we will be retiring the feather icon and logo and replacing it with a new logo that embodies the Foundation's rich history of providing software for the public good.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981155/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The eventfs filesystem provides an interface to the tracepoints that are available
to be used by various Linux tracing tools (e.g. ftrace, perf, uprobes,
etc.); it is meant to be a version of the tracefs filesystem that
dynamically allocates its entries as needed.  The goal is to reduce the memory
required for multiple instances of tracefs, as Steven Rostedt described in
a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/895111/">session</a> at the 2022
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  He returned to the 2024
edition of the summit to talk further about how to make pseudo (or virtual)
filesystems, such as tracefs/eventfs, more like regular Linux filesystems,
where the directory entries (dentries) and inodes are only created (and
cached) as needed.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://sxmo.org">Sxmo</a>, short for "Simple X Mobile", is described on its web site as "<q>a
minimalist environment for Linux mobile devices</q>"; it offers a menu-driven

shell scripts. This peculiar mobile user interface significantly differs
from the prevailing approach—but it works.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/980558/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[There are a number of kernel filesystems that store their directory entries
directly in the directory-entry cache (dcache) without having any permanent
storage for those objects. It started out as a "neat hack" for <a

Al Viro said, at the start of his filesystem-track session at
the
2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  Unfortunately, as the use
of this technique has grown into other filesystems, there has been a lot of
scope creep that has gotten out of control.  He wanted to discuss some new
infrastructure that he is working on to try to clean some of that up.]]></description>

            <title>[$] Offload-friendly network encryption in the kernel</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/980430/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/google/psp">
PSP security protocol</a> (PSP) is a way to transparently encrypt packets by
efficiently offloading encryption and decryption to the network
interface cards (NICs) that Google uses for connections inside its data centers. The
protocol is similar to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec">
IPsec</a>, in that it allows for wrapping arbitrary traffic
in a layer of encryption. The difference is that PSP is encapsulated in UDP, and
designed from the beginning to reduce the amount of state that NICs
have to track in order to send and receive encrypted traffic, allowing for more
simultaneous connections. Jakub Kicinski
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/netdev/20240510030435.120935-1-kuba@kernel.org/">
wants to add support</a> for the protocol to the Linux kernel.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979789/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="https://www.devconf.info/cz/">DevConf.cz 2024</a>,
Marta Lewandowska gave a talk to discuss a
new approach for booting Linux systems, "<a
href="https://pretalx.com/devconf-cz-2024/talk/W3AVCT/">No more boot
loader: Please use the kernel instead</a>". The talk, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywrSDLp926M">available on
YouTube</a>, introduced a new project called nmbl (for "no more bootloader",
pronounced "nimble"). The idea is to get rid of bootloaders (e.g., 
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GNU GRUB</a>) with a
<a
href="https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/unified_kernel_image/">Unified
Kernel Image</a> (UKI) that removes the need for a separate bootloader
altogether. It is early days for nmbl, currently the project is only
being tested for use with virtual machines, but the idea is
compelling. If successful, nmbl could offer security, performance, and
maintenance benefits compared to GRUB and other separate bootloaders.</p>]]></description>

            <title>[$] New features in C++26</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979870/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
ISO releases new <span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++</span>
language standards on a three-year cadence; now that it's been
more than a year since the finalization of
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++23</span>, we have a good idea of what
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/26">
features could be adopted for
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++26</span></a> — although proposals can
still be submitted until January 2025. Of particular interest is the addition of
support for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_pointer">
hazard pointers</a> and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/573424/">
user-space read-copy-update</a> (RCU).
Even though <span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++26</span> is not yet a standard, many of the proposed features are already
available to experiment with in GCC or Clang.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/980447/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Random numbers, it seems, can never be random enough, and they cannot be
generated quickly enough.  The kernel's <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrandom.2.html"><tt>getrandom()</tt></a>
system call might, after years of discussion, be seen as sufficiently
secure by most users, but it is still a system call.  Linux system calls
are relatively fast, but they are necessarily slower than calling a
function directly.  In an attempt to speed the provision of secure random
data to user space, Jason Donenfeld has put together <a
