            <title>[$] Toward safe transmutation in Rust</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/994334/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Currently in Rust, there is no efficient and safe way to turn an array of bytes
into a structure that corresponds to the array. Changing that was the topic of
Jack Wrenn's talk this year at
<a href="https://rustconf.com">
RustConf</a>:
<a href="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/safety-goggles-for-alchemists/">
"Safety Goggles for Alchemists"</a>. The goal is to be able to "transmute" —
Rust's name for this kind of conversion — values into arbitrary user-defined
types in a safer way. Wrenn justified the approach that the project has taken to
accomplish this, and spoke about the future work required to stabilize it.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/993665/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In July, at the GNOME <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/983203/">annual general meeting</a> (AGM),
held at <a
href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2023/12/20/guadec-2024-in-denver-colorado/">GUADEC
2024</a>,
the message from the GNOME Foundation board was that all was well,
financially speaking. Not <em>great</em>, but the foundation was on a
break-even budget and expected to go into its next fiscal year with a
similar budget and headcount. On October&nbsp;7, however, the board <a
href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2024/10/07/update-from-the-board-2024-10/">announced</a>
that it had had to make some cuts, including reducing its staff by
two people. This is not, however, strictly a GNOME problem: similar
organizations, such as the Python Software Foundation (PSF), KDE&nbsp;e.V., 
and the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) are seeing declines in
fundraising while also being affected by inflation.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The Image-Based Linux Summit has by now established itself as a yearly event.
Following on from <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/946526/">last year's edition</a>,
the third edition was held in Berlin on September&nbsp;24, the
day before
<a href="https://all-systems-go.io">
All Systems Go!&nbsp;2024</a> (ASG). The purpose of this event is to gather
stakeholders from various engineering groups and hold friendly but lively
discussions around the topic of image-based Linux — that is, Linux distributions
based around immutable images, instead of mutable root filesystems.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://docs.sigstore.dev/">Sigstore</a> is a 
project that is meant to simplify and improve the process of signing,
verifying, and protecting software. It is a relatively new project, <a
href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sigstore-announces-general-availability-at-sigstorecon-301657741.html">declared</a>
"generally available" in 2022. Python is an early adopter of sigstore; it started <a
href="https://www.python.org/downloads/metadata/sigstore/">providing
signatures for CPython artifacts</a> with <a
href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/">Python&nbsp;3.11</a>
in&nbsp;2022. This is in addition to the <a

providing <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0101/">since at
least&nbsp;2001</a>. Now, Seth&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Larson&mdash;the <a

Foundation</a> (PSF) <a
href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/06/announcing-our-new-security-developer.html">security
developer-in-residence</a>&mdash;would like to deprecate the PGP
signature and move to sigstore exclusively by next year. If that
happens, it will involve some changes in the way that Linux
distributions verify Python releases, since none of the major
distributions have processes for working with sigstore.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The kernel's CPU scheduler currently offers several preemption modes that
implement a range of tradeoffs between system throughput and response time.
Back in September 2023, a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/944686/">discussion
on scheduling</a> led to the concept of "lazy preemption", which could
simplify scheduling in the kernel while providing better results.  Things
went quiet for a while, but lazy preemption has returned in the form of <a

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Email has become somewhat unfashionable as a collaboration tool for
open-source projects, but there are still a number of projects—such as
PostgreSQL and the Linux kernel—that expect contributors to send and
review patches via email. The <a href="https://aerc-mail.org/">aerc</a>

extensible client that is meant to be used for working with Git and

<blockquote class="bq">
For most of this year, we have been working on porting labwc to the

            <title>Kernel prepatch 6.12-rc5</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/995981/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Linus has released <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/995980/">6.12-rc5</a> for testing.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	rc5 looks perfectly normal, and maybe even on the small side of
	normal. The diffstat looks nice and flat too, with the exception of
	the removal of the da8xx fbdev driver due to it having been
	replaced by the tilcdc driver. And I'm sure we're all thinking the
	same thing: "What lovely descriptive driver names we have".
