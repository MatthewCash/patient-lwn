            <title>OpenInfra board calls for input on joining Linux Foundation</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1008386/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Jonathan Bryce has <a href="https://lists.openinfra.org/archives/list/foundation@lists.openinfra.org/thread/3B7OWPRXB4KD2DVX7SYYSHYYRNCKVV46/">announced</a> two open community meetings to hear
input on the topic of the <a href="https://openinfra.org/">OpenInfra
Foundation</a> migrating to the Linux Foundation. Bryce
wrote that the OpenInfra board has carefully evaluated its options,
and sees joining the Linux Foundation as the best way forward.</p>

<p>Like the Linux Foundation, the OpenInfra Foundation is 501(c)(6)
nonprofit. According to the <a
href="https://board.openinfra.org/strategic-consideration/faq">FAQ</a>,
OpenInfra "<q>is in great health, financially and otherwise</q>" with
a growth in membership of about 15% in the last year. However, its
needs in 2025 are different than when it was founded as the OpenStack
Foundation in 2012.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
While the opportunities ahead for open source to make a positive
impact on the world are greater than they have ever been, the
challenges are more significant as well, particularly with respect to
regulations, licensing and geopolitical tensions that threaten global
collaboration.
</blockquote>

<p>The meetings will be held on February&nbsp;11 and February&nbsp;13 as
Zoom calls. The OpenInfra board will schedule a vote after feedback
has been collected and draft governance documents have been
published.</p>

            <title>[$] Offline applications with Earthstar</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005639/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://earthstar-project.org/">
Earthstar</a> is a privacy-oriented,
offline-first, LGPL-licensed database intended to support distributed
applications. Unlike other distributed storage libraries, it
focuses on providing mutable data with human-meaningful names and modification
times, which gives it an interface similar to many non-distributed
key-value databases.
Now, the developers are looking at switching to a new synchronization
protocol â€” one that is general enough that it might see wider adoption.

            <title>[$] FOSDEM keynote causes concerns</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006351/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This year's edition of the <a href="https://fosdem.org/">Free and Open
Source Software Developers' European Meeting</a> (FOSDEM) begins on
February&nbsp;1 in Brussels. The event is widely regarded as one of
the most important open-source conferences. One of the reasons that
FOSDEM is held in high esteem by the community is its non-commercial
nature. It does accept <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2025/about/sponsors/">sponsors</a>, but
sponsorships come with few perks and no "pay-for-play" speaking
slots. Thus, the scheduling of a keynote by Jack
Dorsey&#8288;&mdash;&#8288;primarily known for his role in co-founding Twitter, and
currently CEO and chairman of FOSDEM sponsor <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block%2C_Inc.">Block,&nbsp;Inc.</a>&#8288;&mdash;&#8288;raised eyebrows and led to plans for a protest. The
keynote has since been removed from the schedule, but there are still
a number of lingering questions.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Vendoring Go packages by default in Fedora</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005655/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://go.dev">Go language</a> is designed to make it
easy for developers to <a
href="https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started#call">import other
Go packages</a> and compile everything into a static binary
for simple distribution. Unfortunately, this complicates things for
those who package Go programs for Linux distributions, such as Fedora,
that have guidelines which require dependencies to be packaged
separately. Fedora's <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Go">Go special interest
group</a> (SIG) is asking for relief and a loosening of the bundling
guidelines to allow Go packagers to bundle dependencies into the
packages that need them, otherwise known as vendoring. So far, the
participants in the discussion have seemed largely in favor of the
idea.</p>]]></description>

Last year, LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958792/">examined</a> the changes lined up for
Rust's 2024 edition. Now, with the edition
<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/01/22/rust-2024-beta.html">
ready to be stabilized</a> in February,
it's time to look back at the edition process and see what was
successfully adopted, which new changes were added, and what still remains to
work on. A surprising amount of new work was proposed, implemented, and
stabilized during the year.

            <title>The trouble with the new uretprobes</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1005662/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[A "uretprobe" is a dynamic, user-space tracepoint injected by the kernel
into a running process; <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/trace/uprobetracer.html">this document</a>
tersely describes their use.  Among other things, uretprobes are used by
the <tt>perf</tt> utility to time function calls.  The 6.11 kernel saw a
significant change to uretprobes that improved their performance, but that
change is also creating trouble for some users.  The best way to solve the
problem is not entirely clear.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[As of this writing, just over 4,300 non-merge changesets have been pulled
into the mainline repository for the 6.14 release.  Many of the pull
requests this time around include remarks saying that activity has been
relatively low this time around, presumably due to the holidays.  So those
4,300 changesets are probably closer to the merge-window halfway point than
usual.  Much of the work merged thus far looks more like incremental
improvements than major new initiatives, but there still have been a number
of interesting changes in the mix.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Matthias Clasen has written a short update on a GTK hackfest that
took place at <a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDSEM</a> and what's
coming in GTK 4.18. This includes fixes for pointer sizes in Wayland
when fractional scaling is enabled, removal of the old GL renderer in
favor of the <a
href="https://blog.gtk.org/2024/01/28/new-renderers-for-gtk/">GL
renderer</a> introduced in <a
href="https://download.gnome.org/sources/gtk/4.13/gtk-4.13.6.news">GTK
4.13.6</a>, and deprecation of X11 and Broadway backends with intent
to remove them in GTK 5.</p>

<p>The deprecated backends will remain available until then, and no
action is required by developers at this time, Clasen wrote: "<q>There
is no need to act on deprecations until you are actively porting your
app to the next major version of GTK, which is not on the horizon
yet</q>".</p>
