combined storage and filesystem session at the 2024
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>, Luis Chamberlain led a
discussion on filesystem support for block sizes larger than the usual 4KB
page size, 
which followed up on  <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/933437/">discussion from last year</a>.  While the
session was meant to look at the intersection of larger block sizes
with atomic block writes  that avoid torn
(partial) writes (which was also <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/933015/">discussed last year</a>), it mostly focused on the
filesystem side.  Over time, the
block sizes offered by storage devices have risen from the original
512&nbsp;bytes; Chamberlain
wanted to discuss filesystem support for block sizes larger than 4KB.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The term "memory model" is used in a couple of ways within the kernel.
Perhaps the more obscure meaning is the memory-management subsystem's view
of how physical memory is organized on a given system.  A proper
representation of physical memory will be more efficient in terms of memory
and CPU use.  Since hardware comes in numerous variations, the kernel
supports a number of memory models to match; see <a

            <description><![CDATA[For every page of memory in the system, the kernel maintains a set of page
flags describing how the page is used and various aspects of its current
state.  Space for page flags has been in <a

eliminate or consolidate them whenever possible.  That objective, though,
is hampered by the fact that the purpose of many page flags is not well
understood.  In a memory-management-track session at the <a

subsystem</a> was the first mechanism by which the kernel made huge pages
available to user space; it was added to the 2.5.46 development kernel in
2002.  While hugetlbfs remains useful, it is also viewed as a sort of
second memory-management subsystem that would be best unified with the rest
of the kernel.  At the <a

            <description><![CDATA[Looking up a virtual memory area (VMA) in a process's address space, for
the handling of page faults or any of a number of other tasks, in
multi-threaded processes has long been bedeviled by lock contention in the
kernel.  As a result, developer gatherings have been subjected to many
sessions on how to improve the situation.  At the <a

            <description><![CDATA[Optimizing the kernel's memory use is made much easier if developers have
an accurate idea of how memory is being used, but the kernel's
instrumentation is not as good as it could be.  When Suren Baghdasaryan and
Kent Overstreet <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/932402/">presented</a> their
memory-allocation profiling work, which is meant to address this
shortcoming, at the 2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and
BPF Summit, their objective was uncontroversial but the proposed solution
ran into opposition that played out at length on the mailing lists (<a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20240212213922.783301-1-surenb@google.com/">example</a>)
over the last year.  So it may be a bit surprising that, when the two
returned to the memory-management track in the <a

controversy was gone and the discussion focused on improving details of the
implementation.]]></description>

developers often have to go far out of their way to avoid using too much
stack space.  The size of the stack is also fixed, leading to situations
where it is too small for some code paths, while wastefully large for
others.  At the <a

making the kernel stack size dynamic, making more space available when

            <description><![CDATA[Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems are organized with their CPUs
grouped into nodes, each of which has memory attached to it.  All memory in
the system is accessible from all CPUs, but memory attached to the local
node is faster.  The kernel's <a

years, the NUMA concept has been extended to support the management of
different types of memory in a system, pushing the limits of the mempolicy
subsystem.  In a remotely presented session at the <a

the ways in which the kernel's memory-policy support should evolve to

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/972713/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Working on the Linux kernel has always been unlike working on
many other software projects.
One particularly noticeable difference is the decentralized nature of the
kernel's testing infrastructure. Projects such as
<a href="https://github.com/google/syzkaller">
syzkaller</a>, <a href="https://foundation.kernelci.org/">KernelCI</a>,
or <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/608959/">the kernel self tests</a>
test the kernel in different ways. On February 28, Helen
Koike
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20240228225527.1052240-1-helen.koike@collabora.com/">
posted</a> a patch set that would add continuous integration (CI) scripts for
the whole kernel. The response was generally positive, but several people
suggested changes.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation</a> has <a
href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/results-from-the-2024-freebsd-community-survey-report/">announced</a>
the <a
href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FreeBSD-2024_surv_web-_Final.pdf">2024
FreeBSD Community Survey Report</a>. The report provides a summary of
1,446 responses to an anonymous online survey of FreeBSD users. It
provides insights into user profiles, typical usage, how the FreeBSD
project is viewed, as well as recommendations for expanding the
FreeBSD community and contributor base:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Currently fewer than half of users consider FreeBSD their daily
driver; Individuals are less likely than Corporate Users to consider
FreeBSD primary. The barrier seems to be less about software and more
about hardware support, particularly around Wi-Fi drivers (which are
at the top of the wish list for the Foundation to focus on in the
coming year). A relatively high number of those who don't consider
FreeBSD their main OS say they would consider doing so with hardware
support for desktops and laptops that was equivalent to Linux.
</blockquote>

<p>The <a
href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_comsurv_rawdata.pdf">raw
data</a> for the survey is available as well.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[When redesigning the LWN site in 2002, we thought long and hard about
whether the ability to post comments should be part of it; LWN had not
offered that feature for the first four years of its existence.  There were
already plenty of examples of how comments can go bad by then, but we
decided to trust our readers to keep things under control.  Much of the
time, that trust has proved justified, but there have been times where
things have not gone so well.  This time is quickly becoming one of those
others.]]></description>

            <title>Huston: Calling Time on DNSSEC?</title>

            <description><![CDATA[Geoff Huston <a
href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/dnssec-fin.html">suggests</a>
that it is time to give up on DNSSEC and look for a better way to secure
the Internet namespace.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	What appears to be very clear (to me at any rate!) is that DNSSEC
	as we know it today is just not going anywhere. It's too complex,
	too fragile and just too slow to use for the majority of services
	and their users. Some value its benefits highly enough that they
	are prepared to live with its shortcomings, but that's not the case
	for the overall majority of name holders and for the majority of
	users, and no amount of passionate exhortations about DNSSEC will
	change this.

(Graphite blog)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/974914/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a
href="https://graphite.dev/blog/bitkeeper-linux-story-of-git-creation">This
Graphite blog post</a> retells the history of the BitKeeper fiasco and the
dawn of the Git era.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	When we think of history, we often romanticize it as being born of
	a sudden stroke of inspiration. But the creation of git shows the
	far harsher reality of invention: a slowly escalating disagreement
	over a license; the need for a scrappy backup solution to unblock
	work; and then continued polishing and iteration through years and
	years, led not by the inventor, but rather a community.
