On August 13, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

published</a> the final form of its new post-quantum cryptographic standards. One
key-exchange mechanism and two digital-signature schemes are now officially
sanctioned by the institute. Adopting the new standards should be fairly
painless for most developers, but the overhead added by the schemes could pose
challenges for some applications.

kernel's module-loading infrastructure works.  While <tt>genksyms</tt> has
quietly done its job for decades, that period may soon be coming to an end.
It would seem that <tt>genksyms</tt> is not up to the task of handling Rust

for those new to the PostgreSQL hackers (<a

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The mailing lists are full of acronyms and jargon that might not be
familiar to younger people who did not grow up on email (although text
messages have inherited many of the abbreviations). If you are a
non-native English speaker, or under the age of 30, or not steeped in
the world of tech, I offer some solutions below.</p>

<p>To do this, I downloaded the last year's worth of hackers email,
wrote a program to strip out all the non-human stuff (headers, code
blocks, attachments, etc.), and then did some data analysis on the
results.</p>

	For the wayfinders the process of interacting with maintainers is
	frustrating and slow, and they don't enjoy it as much as
	wayfinding, and because they still only care about the hotel at the
	end, when a maintainer gets into the details of their particular
	intersection they don't want to do anything but go stay in their
	hotel. 
<p>
	The road will get built, it will get traffic on it. There will be
	tunnels where we should have intersections, there will be bridges
	that need to be built from both sides, but I do think it will get
	built.

            <title>Graham: Asking for donations in Plasma</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/987715/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE project</a> plans to directly
ask for donations in the Plasma desktop starting with version
6.2. According to <a
href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/08/28/asking-for-donations-in-plasma/">this
blog post</a> by Nate Graham, users will see <a
href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/4490">a
system notification</a> once per year (in December) asking for a
donation to the non-profit <a href="https://ev.kde.org/">KDE&nbsp;e.V.</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Now, I know that messages like this can be controversial! The
change was carefully considered, and we tried our best to minimize
the annoying-ness factor: It's small and unobtrusive, and no matter
what you do with it (click any button, close it, etc) it'll go away
until next year. It's implemented as a KDE Daemon (KDED) module,
which allows users and distributors to permanently disable it if they
like.
