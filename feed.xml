            <description><![CDATA[David Howells wanted to discuss swap handling in light of multi-page folios
in a combined storage, filesystem, and memory-management session at
the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  Swapping has always been
done with a one-to-one mapping of memory pages to swap slots, he said, but
swapping multi-page folios breaks that assumption.  He wondered if it would
make sense to use filesystem techniques to track swapped-out folios.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982610/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ryan Sipes told the audience during his keynote at
<a href="https://events.gnome.org/event/209/">GUADEC&nbsp;2024</a> in Denver, Colorado that the <a

"probably shouldn't still be alive". Thunderbird, however, is not only
<em>alive</em>&mdash;it is arguably in better shape than ever
before. According to Sipes, the project's turnaround is a result of
governance, storytelling, and learning to be comfortable asking users
for money. He would also like it quite a bit if Linux distributions stopped
turning off telemetry.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Simon Willison, co-creator of the popular <a

gave a keynote presentation at <a

unrelated to that work: large language models (LLMs).
The topic grew out of some other work that he is doing on <a

"<q>tool for exploring and publishing data</q>".  The talk was a look
beyond the hype to try to discover what useful things you can actually do
today using these models.  Unsurprisingly, there were some
cautionary notes from Willison, as well.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982077/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
LWN has covered BPF
<a href="https://lwn.net/1998/0212/#kernel">
since its initial introduction to Linux</a>, usually through the lens of the newest
developments; this can make it hard to view the whole picture. BPF provides
a way to extend a running kernel, without having to recompile and reboot.
It does this in a safe way, so that malicious BPF
programs cannot crash a running kernel, thanks to the BPF verifier. So how does
the verifier actually work, what are its limits, and how has it changed since
the early days of BPF?

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/980598/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Red Hat, through members of the <a
href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/workstation-working-group/">Fedora
Workstation Working Group</a>, has taken another
swing at persuading the Fedora Project to allow metrics related to
the real-world use of the Workstation edition to be collected. The <a
href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f40-change-request-privacy-preserving-telemetry-for-fedora-workstation-system-wide/">first
proposal</a>, aimed for Fedora&nbsp;40, was withdrawn to be reworked
based on <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/937528/">feedback</a>. This time around, the proponents have shifted from
asking for opt-out telemetry to opt-in metrics, with more detail about
what would be collected and the policies that would govern data collection. The
change seems to be on its way to approval by the <a
href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/">Fedora Engineering
Steering Council</a> (FESCo) and is set to take effect for
Fedora&nbsp;42.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981663/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The <a href="https://numpy.org/">
NumPy</a> project <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/2.0.0-notes.html">
released</a> version 2.0.0 on
June 16, the first major release of the widely
used Python-based numeric-computing library since 2006. The release has been planned for some
time, as an opportunity to clean up NumPy's API. As with most NumPy updates,
there are performance improvements to several individual functions. There are only a few new
features, but several backward-incompatible changes, including a change to
NumPy's numeric-promotion rules. Changes to the Python API require relatively minor changes to
Python code using the library, but the changes to the C API may be more
difficult to adapt to. In
both cases, the official
<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/numpy_2_0_migration_guide.html">
migration guide</a> describes what needs to be adapted to the new version.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982085/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The kernel will not consent to execute just any file that happens to be
sitting in a filesystem; there are formalities, such as the checking of
execute permission and consulting security policies, to get through first.
On some systems, security policies have been established to limit execution
to specifically approved programs.  But there are files that are not
executed directly by the kernel; these include scripts fed to language
interpreters like Python, Perl, or a shell.  An attacker who is able to get
an interpreter to execute a file may be able to bypass a system's security
policies.  Mickaël Salaün has been working on closing this hole for years;
the <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240704190137.696169-1-mic@digikod.net">latest

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982099/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Leah Rumancik led a filesystem-track session at
the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> on the testing needed to
qualify 
XFS patches for the stable kernels.  At last year's summit,
Rumancik, Amir Goldstein, and Chandan Babu Rajendra <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/934941/">presented</a> on their efforts to test and
backport fixes for the XFS filesystem to three separate stable kernels.
There has been some longstanding <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838819/">unhappiness in
the XFS-development community
with the stable-kernel process</a>, which led to
backports ceasing for that filesystem until Goldstein <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/896523/">started working on XFS testing</a> for the stable
trees a few years ago.  In this year's session, Rumancik updated
attendees on how things had gone over the last year and wanted to discuss some
remaining pain points for the process.]]></description>

in "<q>seemingly random User Interface changes</q>":</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
A gentle way of describing Forgejo User eXperience is that it is an
acquired taste: it grew over the years, driven by the inspiration of
the person with the keyboard in their hand. Once implemented it almost
never changed. A user who started with Forgejo in 2022 can only see
minor changes in 2024 and not all of them make intuitive sense. The
solution to this problem is simple and was identified early on: User
Research. But only in the making of Forgejo v8.0 did it get some
momentum.
