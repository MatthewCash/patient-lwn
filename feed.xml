            <description><![CDATA[<p>Reading an established open-source project's developer mailing list
may leave new contributors wishing they had a decoder ring. Greg
Sabino Mullane has written up a valuable <a
href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/understanding-the-postgres-hackers-mailing-list">explainer</a>
for those new to the PostgreSQL hackers (<a
href="https://www.postgresql.org/list/pgsql-hackers/">pgsql-hackers</a>)
mailing list that may also be useful for decoding other lists as well:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The mailing lists are full of acronyms and jargon that might not be
familiar to younger people who did not grow up on email (although text
messages have inherited many of the abbreviations). If you are a
non-native English speaker, or under the age of 30, or not steeped in
the world of tech, I offer some solutions below.</p>

<p>To do this, I downloaded the last year's worth of hackers email,
wrote a program to strip out all the non-human stuff (headers, code
blocks, attachments, etc.), and then did some data analysis on the
results.</p>

            <title>Airlie: On Rust, Linux, developers, maintainers</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/987849/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Dave Airlie <a
href="https://airlied.blogspot.com/2024/08/on-rust-linux-developers-maintainers.html">makes
an analogy</a> between the stages of road building and those of adding Rust
to the Linux kernel.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	For the wayfinders the process of interacting with maintainers is
	frustrating and slow, and they don't enjoy it as much as
	wayfinding, and because they still only care about the hotel at the
	end, when a maintainer gets into the details of their particular
	intersection they don't want to do anything but go stay in their
	hotel. 
<p>
	The road will get built, it will get traffic on it. There will be
	tunnels where we should have intersections, there will be bridges
	that need to be built from both sides, but I do think it will get
	built.

            <title>Graham: Asking for donations in Plasma</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/987715/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE project</a> plans to directly
ask for donations in the Plasma desktop starting with version
6.2. According to <a
href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/08/28/asking-for-donations-in-plasma/">this
blog post</a> by Nate Graham, users will see <a
href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/4490">a
system notification</a> once per year (in December) asking for a
donation to the non-profit <a href="https://ev.kde.org/">KDE&nbsp;e.V.</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Now, I know that messages like this can be controversial! The
change was carefully considered, and we tried our best to minimize
the annoying-ness factor: It's small and unobtrusive, and no matter
what you do with it (click any button, close it, etc) it'll go away
until next year. It's implemented as a KDE Daemon (KDED) module,
which allows users and distributors to permanently disable it if they
like.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/985853/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On July 30, Al Viro sent
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240730050927.GC5334@ZenIV/">
a patch set</a> to the linux-fsdevel mailing list with a
comprehensive cover letter explaining his
recent work on ensuring that the kernel's internal representation of
file descriptors are used correctly in the kernel.
File descriptors are ubiquitous; many system calls
need to handle them. Viro's review
identified a few existing bugs, and may prevent more in the future. He also had
suggestions for ways to keep uses consistent throughout the kernel.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/974969/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Linux installers receive a disproportionate amount of attention
compared to the amount of time that most users spend with them. Ideally,
a user spends only a few minutes using the installer, versus years using
the distribution after it is installed. Yet, the installer sets the
first impression, and if it fails to do its job, little else matters.
Installers also have to continually evolve to keep pace with new
hardware, changes in distribution packaging (such as image-based Linux
distributions), and so forth. Along those lines, the SUSE team that maintains the
venerable <a href="https://yast.opensuse.org/">YaST</a> installer has
decided it's time to start (almost) fresh with a new Linux installer
project, called <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/agama">Agama</a>,
for new projects. YaST is not going away as an administration tool,
but it is likely to be relieved of installer duties at some point.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[One tactic often used by attackers set on compromising a system is <a

short, the attacker fills as much of the heap as possible with crafted data

heap spraying can be blocked, attackers will lose an important tool.  The
kernel has some heap-spraying defenses now, including the <a

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/985346/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Python has had
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/656898/">formatted string literals</a>
(<span style="white-space:nowrap">f-strings</span>), a syntactic shorthand for building
strings, since 2015. Recently, Jim Baker, Guido van Rossum, and Paul Everitt have
proposed
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/">
PEP 750</a> ("Tag Strings For Writing Domain-Specific Languages") which would
generalize and expand that mechanism to provide Python library writers with additional
flexibility. Reactions to the proposed change were somewhat positive, although
there was a good deal of discussion of (and opposition to)
the PEP's inclusion of lazy evaluation of template parameters.

that most (but not all) of the claims in the GitHub Copilot lawsuit have
been dismissed with prejudice by the judge.

<blockquote class="bq">
	Judge Jon Tigar's ruling, unsealed last week, leaves only two
	claims standing: one accusing the companies of an open-source
	license violation and another alleging breach of contract. This
	decision marks a substantial setback for the developers who argued
	that GitHub Copilot, which uses OpenAI's technology and is owned by
	Microsoft, unlawfully trained on their work.

The Ubuntu project turned 20 this year, but is still in constant
flux. The advent of new communication platforms, new projects under
our umbrella, and the ever-growing popularity of the project requires
our community to evolve. We need to make sure Ubuntu is set to tackle
the challenges of the next 20 years. It needs a strong and active
community council to guide the project forwards.
