            <description><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, <a
href="https://pygobject.gnome.org/">PyGObject</a>&mdash;the Python
package that provides bindings for <a
href="https://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> and <a
href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> applications&mdash;was not
faring particularly well. Several maintainers had left the project and its
development was not keeping pace with changes in GTK. At this year's
GUADEC, Dan Yeaw presented a <a
href="https://events.gnome.org/event/209/contributions/757/">talk</a>
about the project's decline, improvements in the last year, and his
experience getting involved in an undermaintained project.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983340/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
A <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/841797/">
bootstrappable build</a> is one that builds existing
software from scratch — for example, building GCC without relying on an existing
copy of GCC. In 2023, the Guix project
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/930650/">announced</a> that the project had reduced the size
of the binary bootstrap seed needed to build its operating system to just 357-bytes —
not counting the Linux kernel required to run the build process. Now, the
<a href="https://github.com/fosslinux/live-bootstrap">live-bootstrap</a> project
has gone a step further and removed the need for an existing kernel at all.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983105/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[At the 2024 <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>, John Groves led
a session on famfs, which is a filesystem he has developed that uses the
kernel's <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/dax.html">direct-access (DAX)</a>
mechanism to access memory that is shareable between hosts.  The discussion
was aimed at whether a different approach should be taken and, in
particular, whether FUSE should be used instead of implementing as an
in-kernel filesystem.  As noted in the <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240229002020.85535-1-john@groves.net/">thread</a> about his
proposal for an LSFMM+BPF session, and the mailing-list discussions on <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/cover.1708709155.git.john%40groves.net/">the first</a> and <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/cover.1714409084.git.john@groves.net/">second
version</a> of his patch set, there is some skepticism that a new in-kernel
filesystem is warranted for the use case.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983169/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[One of the simplest hardening concepts to understand is that memory should
never be both writable and executable, otherwise an attacker can use it to
load and run arbitrary code.  That rule is generally followed in Linux
systems, but there is a glaring loophole that is exploitable from user
space to inject code into a running process.  Attackers have duly exploited
it.  A new effort to close the hole ran into trouble early in the merge
window, but a solution may yet be found in time for the 6.11 kernel
release.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/983186/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/980447/">the previous episode</a> of the
<tt>vgetrandom()</tt> story, Jason Donenfeld had put together a version of
the <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrandom.2.html"><tt>getrandom()</tt></a>
system call that ran in user space, significantly improving performance for
applications that need a lot of random data while retaining all of the
guarantees provided by the system call.  At that time, it seemed that a
consensus had built around the implementation and that it was headed toward
the mainline in that form.  A few milliseconds after that article was
posted, though, a Linus-Torvalds-shaped obstacle appeared in its path.
That obstacle has been overcome and this work has now been merged for the
6.11 kernel, but its form has changed somewhat.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982398/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
On July 12, Jocelyn Falempe
<a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f42-change-proposal-enable-drm-panic-system-wide/125542">
proposed</a> a change to the configuration options that Fedora sets for its
kernels, in order to make kernel panics easier to report.
Falempe would like to enable the kernel's recently added
DRM-panic feature, which adds
a graphical crash screen that is reminiscent of the infamous
Windows "blue screen of death" for kernel panics. The feature introduces a few
tradeoffs, including currently limited driver support, so the proposal spawned a
good deal of discussion.

            <title>Firefox support added to Puppeteer</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/984733/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Mozilla has <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/08/puppeteer-support-for-firefox/">announced</a> that <a href="https://pptr.dev/">Puppeteer</a>, a browser automation and testing library, now has first-class support for Firefox using the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/">WebDriver BiDi</a> protocol. Puppeteer can be used to drive headless browser instances, and is commonly used for automated end-to-end web site tests.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Whilst the features offered by Puppeteer won't be a surprise,
bringing support to multiple browsers has been a significant
undertaking. The Firefox support is not based on a Firefox-specific
automation protocol, but on WebDriver BiDi, a cross browser protocol
that's undergoing standardization at the W3C, and currently has
implementation in both Gecko and Chromium. This use of a
cross-browser protocol should make it much easier to support many
different browsers going forward.

<blockquote class="bq">
Over the past two years, STF has successfully contracted over 40 FOSS
projects, enhancing their technical sustainability through targeted
milestones. However, the activities of maintainers, who often work on
multiple FOSS projects, are hard to quantify for funding applications,
as the demands and challenges vary and can change quickly. This is
where the fellowship for maintainers comes into play.

            <description><![CDATA[David Howells wanted to discuss swap handling in light of multi-page folios
in a combined storage, filesystem, and memory-management session at
the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  Swapping has always been
done with a one-to-one mapping of memory pages to swap slots, he said, but
swapping multi-page folios breaks that assumption.  He wondered if it would
make sense to use filesystem techniques to track swapped-out folios.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982610/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ryan Sipes told the audience during his keynote at
<a href="https://events.gnome.org/event/209/">GUADEC&nbsp;2024</a> in Denver, Colorado that the <a
href="https://thunderbird.net/">Thunderbird</a> mail client 
"probably shouldn't still be alive". Thunderbird, however, is not only
<em>alive</em>&mdash;it is arguably in better shape than ever
before. According to Sipes, the project's turnaround is a result of
governance, storytelling, and learning to be comfortable asking users
for money. He would also like it quite a bit if Linux distributions stopped
turning off telemetry.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Simon Willison, co-creator of the popular <a

gave a keynote presentation at <a

unrelated to that work: large language models (LLMs).
The topic grew out of some other work that he is doing on <a

"<q>tool for exploring and publishing data</q>".  The talk was a look
beyond the hype to try to discover what useful things you can actually do
today using these models.  Unsurprisingly, there were some
cautionary notes from Willison, as well.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982077/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
LWN has covered BPF
<a href="https://lwn.net/1998/0212/#kernel">
since its initial introduction to Linux</a>, usually through the lens of the newest
developments; this can make it hard to view the whole picture. BPF provides
a way to extend a running kernel, without having to recompile and reboot.
It does this in a safe way, so that malicious BPF
programs cannot crash a running kernel, thanks to the BPF verifier. So how does
the verifier actually work, what are its limits, and how has it changed since
the early days of BPF?

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/980598/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Red Hat, through members of the <a
href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/workstation-working-group/">Fedora
Workstation Working Group</a>, has taken another
swing at persuading the Fedora Project to allow metrics related to
the real-world use of the Workstation edition to be collected. The <a
href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f40-change-request-privacy-preserving-telemetry-for-fedora-workstation-system-wide/">first
proposal</a>, aimed for Fedora&nbsp;40, was withdrawn to be reworked
based on <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/937528/">feedback</a>. This time around, the proponents have shifted from
asking for opt-out telemetry to opt-in metrics, with more detail about
what would be collected and the policies that would govern data collection. The
change seems to be on its way to approval by the <a
href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/">Fedora Engineering
Steering Council</a> (FESCo) and is set to take effect for
Fedora&nbsp;42.</p>]]></description>

            <title>[$] A new major version of NumPy</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981663/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The <a href="https://numpy.org/">
NumPy</a> project <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/2.0.0-notes.html">
released</a> version 2.0.0 on
June 16, the first major release of the widely
used Python-based numeric-computing library since 2006. The release has been planned for some
time, as an opportunity to clean up NumPy's API. As with most NumPy updates,
there are performance improvements to several individual functions. There are only a few new
features, but several backward-incompatible changes, including a change to
NumPy's numeric-promotion rules. Changes to the Python API require relatively minor changes to
Python code using the library, but the changes to the C API may be more
difficult to adapt to. In
both cases, the official
<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/numpy_2_0_migration_guide.html">
migration guide</a> describes what needs to be adapted to the new version.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982085/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The kernel will not consent to execute just any file that happens to be
sitting in a filesystem; there are formalities, such as the checking of
execute permission and consulting security policies, to get through first.
On some systems, security policies have been established to limit execution
to specifically approved programs.  But there are files that are not
executed directly by the kernel; these include scripts fed to language
interpreters like Python, Perl, or a shell.  An attacker who is able to get
an interpreter to execute a file may be able to bypass a system's security
policies.  Mickaël Salaün has been working on closing this hole for years;
the <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240704190137.696169-1-mic@digikod.net">latest

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982099/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Leah Rumancik led a filesystem-track session at
the 2024 <a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a> on the testing needed to
qualify 
XFS patches for the stable kernels.  At last year's summit,
Rumancik, Amir Goldstein, and Chandan Babu Rajendra <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/934941/">presented</a> on their efforts to test and
backport fixes for the XFS filesystem to three separate stable kernels.
There has been some longstanding <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838819/">unhappiness in
the XFS-development community
with the stable-kernel process</a>, which led to
backports ceasing for that filesystem until Goldstein <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/896523/">started working on XFS testing</a> for the stable
trees a few years ago.  In this year's session, Rumancik updated
attendees on how things had gone over the last year and wanted to discuss some
remaining pain points for the process.]]></description>
