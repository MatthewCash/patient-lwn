            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1010898/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a
href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2025-February/226464.html">Version
25.0.0</a> of the Mesa graphics library has been released.  "<q>The flashiest addition is probably the support for Vulkan 1.4 by Anv (Intel),
Asahi (Apple), Lavapipe (software), NVK (NVIDIA), PanVK (Mali), RADV (AMD),
and Turnip (Qualcomm).

Users can expect the usual flurry of improvements across all drivers and

center, and <a

            <title>Lange: The secret maze of Debian images</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1010855/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Debian Developer Thomas Lange has written a <a
href="https://blog.fai-project.org/posts/cdimages-maze/">blog post</a>
in the attempt to help users find the right Debian image for their
systems.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
It's difficult to find the right Debian image. We have thousands of
ISO files and cloud images and we support multiple CPU architectures
and several download methods. The directory structure of our main
image server is like a maze, and our web pages for downloading are
also confusing.

a new REST API and embedded web server. Its Docker/OCI image is now
based on <a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a>

            <title>Three stable kernels under the sky</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1010352/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman has released three more stable kernels:
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1010354/">6.13.3</a>,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1010356/">6.12.14</a>, and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1010357/">6.6.78</a>.
There was a bit of confusion that resulted in the patch for
<a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-21687">CVE 2025-21687</a>
getting applied twice â€” but that doesn't result in any problems for users of the
kernel, just a bit of extra noise in the CVE database, so Kroah-Hartman has
decided to leave the releases as-is instead of rushing another point release.

testing; the announcement, for unknown reasons, went only to the

<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	So the first few weeks of the 6.14 release development were

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1007689/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Jake Hillion gave
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4489-concurrency-testing-using-custom-linux-schedulers/">
a presentation</a> at
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/">
FOSDEM</a> about using
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/scheduler/sched-ext.html">
sched_ext</a>, the BPF
scheduling framework that was introduced in kernel version 6.12, to help find
elusive concurrency problems. In collaboration with Johannes Bechberger, he has
built a scheduler that can reveal theoretically possible but unobserved
concurrency bugs in test code in a few minutes. Since their scheduler only
relies on mainline kernel features, it can theoretically be applied to any
application that runs on Linux â€” although there are a number of caveats since
the project is still in its early days.

            <title>[$] An update on sealed system mappings</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006375/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Jeff Xu has been working on
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20241125202021.3684919-1-jeffxu@google.com/">
a patch set</a> that makes certain mappings in a process's address space
impossible to change, sealing them against tampering. This has some potential
security benefits â€” mainly, making
sure that someone cannot relocate the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/446528/">vsyscall and
vDSO mappings</a> â€” but some kernel developers haven't
been impressed with the patches.
While the core functionality (sealing the mappings) is sound, some of the
supporting code for enabling and disabling the new feature caused concern by
going against the normal design for such things. Reviewers also questioned
how this feature would interact with checkpointing and with sandboxing.

            <title>[$] The rest of the 6.14 merge window</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006378/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[By the time that Linus Torvalds <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1007546/">released
6.14-rc1</a> and closed the merge window for this development cycle, some
9,307 non-merge changesets had been pulled into the mainline
repository â€” the lowest level of merge-window activity seen in years.
There were, nonetheless, a number of interesting changes in the
5,000 commits pulled since <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1005651/">the
first-half merge-window summary</a> was written.]]></description>

            <title>[$] New horizons for Julia</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006117/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>, a free, general-purpose
programming language aimed at science, engineering, and related arenas of
technical computing, has steadily improved and widened its scope of
application since its <a
href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia">initial public
release in&nbsp;2012</a>. As part of its <a
href="https://julialang.org/blog/2024/10/julia-1.11-highlights/">1.11&nbsp;release</a> from late 2024, Julia made several inroads into areas
outside of its traditional focus, provided its users with advances in
tooling, and has seen several improvements in performance and programmer
convenience. 
These recent developments in and
around Julia go a long way to answer several longstanding complaints from
both new and experienced users. We last <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958337/">looked
in on the language</a> one year ago,
for its previous major release, Julia&nbsp;1.10.]]></description>

            <title>[$] A look at the openSUSE board election</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006916/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The election to replace outgoing <a
href="https://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a> board members is
underway, with four candidates vying for three seats. The election was
initially scheduled to be completed in December, but the timeline was <a
href="https://news.opensuse.org/2025/01/07/board-elections-for-three-seats-revised/">extended</a>
due to too few candidates standing for the seats. Voting closes on
February&nbsp;2 and the results are expected to be announced on
February&nbsp;3.</p>]]></description>

            <title>[$] Resistance to Rust abstractions for DMA mapping</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1006805/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[While the path toward the ability to write device drivers in Rust has been
anything but smooth, steady progress has been made and that goal is close
to being achieved â€” for some types of drivers at least.  Device drivers
need to be able to set up memory areas for direct memory access (DMA)
transfers, though; that means Rust drivers will need a set of
abstractions to interface with the kernel's DMA-mapping subsystem.  Those
abstractions have run into resistance that has the potential to block
progress on the Rust-for-Linux project as a whole.]]></description>

            <title>Codeberg responds to hate attacks</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1009227/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg</a> development forge has
recently been subject to sustained attacks resulting in, among other
things, abusive email being sent to the site's users.  The organization has
now put up <a
href="https://blog.codeberg.org/we-stay-strong-against-hate-and-hatred.html">a
description and a defiant response</a>:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Extreme right forces actively target members of our communities and
	discriminate based on ethnicity and gender, political background,
	sexual orientation, disabilities, nationality and faith. However
	diversity is an important asset in free/libre software communities
	and it is what makes our software great and development productive.
<p>
	By targeting some of our most active translators, nicest
	designers, best developers and all other motivated contributors,
	they are hurting the free/libre software ecosystem as a whole.
