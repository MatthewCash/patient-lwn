            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/978955/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/">
Unison</a> is a
MIT-licensed programming language, in development since 2013, that
explores the ramifications of making code immutable and stored in a database,
instead of a set of text files.
Unison supports a greatly simplified model for distributed
programming â€” one that describes the configuration of and communication between
programs in the same language as the programs themselves. Along the way, it
introduces a new approach to interfacing with programming languages, which is tailored to
its design.

(bootc). The talk, which was streamed to YouTube for those of us who
didn't attend DevConf.cz in person, provided a solid overview of bootc
and the problems it is intended to solve. The idea behind bootc is to
make creating operating-system images just as easy as creating
application-container images while using the same tools.</p>]]></description>

desktop-oriented operating system based on <a

goal of the project is to lower the barrier to entry of using FreeBSD
on a desktop or laptop system, and it largely succeeds at this. While it has a few rough edges
that make it hard to recommend for the average desktop user, it is
a fine choice for users who want a desktop with FreeBSD underpinnings
such as the Z File System (ZFS), and the <a

            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/532593/">User namespaces</a> in Linux create an
environment in which all privileges are granted, but their effect is
contained within the namespace; they have become an important tool for the
implementation of containers.  They have also become a significant source
of worries for people who do not like the increased attack surface they
create for the kernel.  Various attempts have been made to restrict that
attack surface over the years; the latest is <a

Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo spoke at the 2024

about his work on
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/335942/">
Poke-a-hole</a> (pahole),
a program that has expanded greatly over the years, but which was relevant to the
BPF track because it produces BPF Type Format (BTF) information from DWARF
debugging information. He covered some small changes to the program, and then
went into detail about the new support for data-type profiling. His

several examples.

	A major reason for Sun's early success was that they in effect

	that NeWS could not displace X11 as the Unix standard window system
	without being equally open source. But Sun's management looked at
	NeWS and saw superior technology, an extension of the PostScript
	that Adobe was selling, and couldn't bring themselves to give it

Zurich.  Development of Scientific Linux stopped with SL7, with the labs
switching to CentOS thereafter, but the SL7 release was supported through
to the bitter end.  Thanks are due to all who built and supported
