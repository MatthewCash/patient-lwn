            <title>An Algol 68 front end for GCC</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003916/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[While some people are focused on new and trendy languages, José Marchesi
has, instead, gifted the world with <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250101020952.18404-1-jose.marchesi@oracle.com">a GCC front
end for the Algol 68 language</a>.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	This WIP is a GCC front-end for Algol 68, the fascinating,
	generally poorly understood and often vilified programming
	language.  It is common knowledge that Algol 68 was well ahead of
	its time back when it was introduced, and anyone who knows the
	language well will suspect this probably still holds true today,
	but more than fifty years after the publication of the Revised
	Report the world may finally be ready for it, or perhaps not, we
	shall see.
</blockquote>
<p>
For those who see Algol 68 as too new, there was also <a

            <title>LineageOS 22.1 released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003862/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://lineageos.org/Changelog-29/">Version 22.1</a> of the
Android-based LineageOS distribution is out.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	We've been hard at work since Android 15's release in September,
	adapting our unique features to this new version of
	Android. Android 15 introduced several complex changes under the
	hood, but due to our previous efforts adapting to Google's
	UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14, we were able to
	rebase onto Android 15's code-base faster than anticipated.
<p>
	Additionally, this is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a
	device perspective we have seen in years. This means that many more
	devices are ready on day one that we'd typically expect to have up
	this early in the cycle!
<p>
	Last, but not least, we even had enough time and resources to
	introduce not one, but two new exciting apps! The first one,
	Twelve, will replace our aging music app, while the other one,
	Camelot, will let you view PDF files.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman has posted three new stable kernel updates:
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003608/">6.12.7</a>,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003609/">6.6.68</a>, and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003610/">6.1.122</a>. As usual, he warns that all users of
stable kernels must upgrade, although for many systems that seems unlikely to
happen until January.

            <title>Kernel prepatch 6.13-rc4</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003223/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Linus has released <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003222/">6.13-rc4</a> for testing.
"<q>So this definitely is looking a bit smaller than most rc4s, and I
expect (and hope) that rc5 will be absolutely tiny because you should
all already be relaxing over the xmas holidays.

But hey, if somebody is out there keeping the lights on, please do
keep testing.</q>"]]></description>
