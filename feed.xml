            <title>Three stable kernel updates</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1003607/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman has posted three new stable kernel updates:
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003608/">6.12.7</a>,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003609/">6.6.68</a>, and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1003610/">6.1.122</a>. As usual, he warns that all users of
stable kernels must upgrade, although for many systems that seems unlikely to
happen until January.

            <title>[$] Emacs code completion can cause compromise</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1002046/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Emacs has had a
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/966547/">few bugs</a> related to accidentally
permitting the execution of untrusted code. Unfortunately, it seems as though
another bug of that sort has appeared — and may be harder to patch,
because the problem comes from the way Emacs handles expansion of Lisp macros in
code being analyzed. The
vulnerability is only practically exploitable in a non-default configuration, so
not every Emacs user has something to worry about. The Emacs
developers are reportedly working on a fix, but have not yet shared details
about it. In the meantime, every Emacs version since at least
26.1 (released in May&nbsp;2018) through the current development version is vulnerable.

            <title>[$] Using Guile for Emacs</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001645/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is, famously, an
editor—perhaps far more—that is extensible using its own
variant of the Lisp programming language, <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/">Emacs
Lisp</a> (or Elisp).  <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2024/">This year's
edition of EmacsConf</a>, which is an annual "gathering" that has been held
online for the past five years, had two separate talks on using a different
variant of Lisp, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile</a>,
for Emacs.  Both projects would preserve Elisp compatibility, which is a
must, but they would use Guile differently.  The first talk we will cover
was given by Robin Templeton, who described the relaunch of the <a
href="https://guile-emacs.org/">Guile-Emacs project</a>, which would replace
the Elisp in Emacs with a compiler using Guile.  A subsequent article will look
at the other talk, which is about <a
href="https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/gypsum/">an Emacs clone</a> written
using Guile.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1001526/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Commits in the Git source-code management system are identified by the
SHA-1 hash of their contents — though the specific hash <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/898522/">may change someday</a>.  The full hash is a
160-bit quantity, normally written as a 40-character hexadecimal string.
While those strings are convenient for computers to work with, humans find
them to be a bit unwieldy, so it is common to abbreviate the hash values to
shorter strings.  Geert Uytterhoeven recently <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/cover.1733421037.git.geert+renesas@glider.be">proposed</a>
increasing the length of those abbreviated hashes as used in the kernel
community, but the problem he was working to solve may not be as urgent as
it seems.]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1000434/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Handling time in a networked environment is never easy. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">
Network Time Protocol</a> (NTP) has been used to synchronize clocks across the
internet for almost 40 years — but, as computers and networks get faster, the
degree of synchronization it offers is not sufficient for some use cases. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol">
Precision Time Protocol</a> (PTP) attempts to provide more precise
time synchronization, at the
expense of requiring dedicated kernel and hardware
support. The Linux kernel has
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d94ba80ebbea17f036cecb104398fbcd788aa742">
supported PTP</a> since 2011, but the protocol has recently seen
<a href="https://www.broadcom.com/blog/time-synchronization-in-data-center-networks">
increasing use in data centers</a>. As PTP becomes more widespread, it may be
useful to have an idea how it compares to NTP.

out.]]></description>
