            <title>Dolstra steps down from NixOS Foundation board</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/971973/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The NixOS Foundation board
<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundation-board-giving-power-to-the-community/44552">
announced</a> on April 30 that Eelco Dolstra is stepping down from the board
following the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/970824/">recent calls for his resignation</a>.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Eelco is the principal author of Nix and undoubtedly a central figure in the
ecosystem that grew around it. We confirm that Eelco showed no intention to be
perceived as or act like the BDFL [Benevolent Dictator for Life]
of the Nix ecosystem, or the Nix code base. To
commit to that in a timely manner, he has decided to formally step down from the
board.
</blockquote>

<p>
The board also announced their intent to set up new, explicit governance for the
project, answerable to the community:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
We will appoint a constitutional assembly within the next 14 days.
Its task will be to set up a new governance structure, run by the
community, that is capable of serving the community's needs. Once
established, we will delegate our power to institutions within that
new structure. This entire process will take place in a public space,
such that it's traceable for anyone concerned. We are committed to
listening to everyone who may help with solving the problems the
community is facing.

            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/112353324518585654">This
Mastodon stream</a> from Lennart Poettering describes a <tt>sudo</tt>
replacement — called <tt>run0</tt> — that will be part of the upcoming
systemd 256 release.  It takes a rather different approach to the execution
of privileged commands, avoiding the use of setuid (which he calls "SUID")
permissions entirely.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	So, in my ideal world, we'd have an OS entirely without SUID. Let's
	throw out the concept of SUID on the dump of UNIX' bad ideas. An
	execution context for privileged code that is half under the
	control of unprivileged code and that needs careful manual clean-up
	is just not how security engineering should be done in 2024
	anymore.

            <title>Amarok 3.0 &quot;Castaway&quot; released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/971568/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://apps.kde.org/amarok/">Amarok</a> music player project
has <a
href="https://blogs.kde.org/2024/04/29/amarok-3.0-castaway-released/">announced</a>
the release of version&nbsp;3.0, which is codenamed "Castaway".  It is the first
stable version using Qt&nbsp;5 and KDE Frameworks&nbsp;5, and the first stable
release since the final Qt-4-based&nbsp;2.9.0 in 2018.
<blockquote class="bq">
The road to 3.0 has not been a short one. Much of the Qt5/KF5 porting was done in 2015 already, but finishing and polishing everything up has been a slow, sometimes ongoing and sometimes stalled process ever since. 3.0 Alpha was released in February 2021 and has been since used by many people, as have been nightly builds of git master available for various distributions. Now in the past few months, an effort was made to get everything ready for a proper 3.0 release.
<p>
Common usecases should work quite well, and in addition to fixing KF5 port
related regressions reported in pre-releases, 3.0 features many bugfixes
and implemented features for longstanding issues, the oldest such
documented being from 2009. However, with more than 20 years of development
history, it is likely that not every feature Amarok has been tested
thoroughly in the new release, and specifically some Internet services that
have changed their API in recent years are not available, at least for
now. It might well be that getting them in better state wouldn't require
huge effort, however, so if you know your way with Qt and KDE Frameworks
and your favourite Internet music service does not work with Amarok 3.0,
you are extremely welcome to join in and help!

            <description><![CDATA[Robert McQueen has posted <a
href="https://ramcq.net/2024/04/26/update-from-the-gnome-board/">a message
from the GNOME Foundation board</a> describing the current financial
situation, plans to improve it, and an increase in the size of the board.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	The Foundation has a reserves policy which specifies a minimum
	amount of money we have to keep in our accounts. This is so that if
	there is a significant interruption to our usual income, we can
	preserve our core operations while we work on new funding
	sources. We've now "hit the buffers" of this reserves policy,
	meaning the Board can't approve any more deficit budgets – to keep
	spending at the same level we must increase our income.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/969908/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/967180">
The recent XZ backdoor</a> has sparked a lot of discussion about how the open-source
community links and packages software. One possible
security improvement being discussed
is changing how
projects like systemd link to dynamic libraries that are only used for
optional functionality: using
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html">
<tt>dlopen()</tt></a> to load those libraries only
when required. This could
shrink the attack surface exposed by dependencies, but the approach is not
without downsides — most prominently, it makes discovering which dynamic
libraries a program depends on harder.
On April 11, Lennart Poettering proposed one way to eliminate that problem
<a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/32234">
in a systemd RFC on GitHub</a>.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/969185/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Kumar Kartikeya Dwivedi has been working to add support for exceptions to BPF
since mid-2023. In July, Dwivedi posted
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/938435/">
the first patch set</a> in this effort, which adds support for basic stack unwinding.
In February 2024, he posted
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/bpf/20240201042109.1150490-1-memxor@gmail.com/">
the second patch set</a>
aimed at letting the kernel release resources held by the BPF program when an
exception occurs. This makes exceptions usable in many more contexts.

            <title>[$] Completing the EEVDF scheduler</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/969062/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/925371/">Earliest Virtual Deadline First (EEVDF)
scheduler</a> was merged as an option for the 6.6 kernel.  It represents a
major change to how CPU scheduling is done on Linux systems, but the EEVDF
front has been relatively quiet since then.  Now, though, scheduler
developer Peter Zijlstra has returned from a long absence to post <a
href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20240405102754.435410987@infradead.org/">a patch
series</a> intended to finish the EEVDF work.  Beyond some fixes, this work
includes a significant behavioral change and a new feature intended to help
latency-sensitive tasks.]]></description>

            <title>[$] A tale of two troublesome drivers</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/969383/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The kernel project merges dozens of drivers with every development cycle,
and almost every one of those drivers is entirely uncontroversial.
Occasionally, though, a driver submission raises wider questions, leading
to lengthy discussion and, perhaps, opposition.  That is currently the case
with two separate drivers, both with ties to the networking subsystem.  One
of them is hung up on questions of whether (and how) all device
functionality should be made available to user space, while the other has
run into turbulence because it drives a device that is unobtainable outside
of a single company.]]></description>
