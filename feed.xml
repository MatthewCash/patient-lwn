href="https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/Release_notes/1.4">version&nbsp;1.4</a>

brings new features, user-interface improvements, new and improved
file-format support, and important changes to the code base. The changes in
this release should improve the user experience for both casual and
professional designers, and make Inkscape more compatible with proprietary
vector-graphics software, including Adobe Illustrator and Affinity
Designer.]]></description>

            <title>[$] BTF, Rust, and the kernel toolchain</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/991719/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html">
BPF Type Format</a> (BTF),
BPF's debugging information format, has undergone rapid evolution to match
the evolving needs of BPF programs. José Marchesi spoke at Kangrejos about some
of that work — and how it could impact Rust, specifically. He discussed debug
information, kernel-specific relocations, and the planned changes to kernel
stack unwinding. Each of these will require some amount of work to fully
support in Rust, but preliminary signs look promising.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/991199/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[One concern that has often been expressed about the Rust language is that
there is only one compiler for it.  That makes it hard to say what the
standard version of the language is and restricts the architectures that
can be targeted by Rust code to those that the available compiler supports.
Adding a Rust frontend to GCC would do much to address those concerns; at
the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2024">2024 GNU Tools
Cauldron</a>, Pierre-Emmanuel Patry gave an update on the state of that
work and what its objectives are.]]></description>

Tathagata Roy has been working to make the

Coccinelle</a> tool that is used (among other things)
to automate the refactoring of C code work on Rust

including the creative approaches necessary to work with Rust's more complicated

popular</a> open&#8209;source blogging and content&#8209;management platform. In its

child for open source, similar to Linux and Firefox. It introduced the
concept of open source to millions of bloggers, small&#8209;business owners,
and others who have deployed WordPress to support their web&#8209;publishing
needs. Unfortunately, it is now in the spotlight due to an increasingly
ugly dispute between two companies, <a

backdoor</a>, the Debian project has revisited some of the
patches included in its <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>

will be splitting out support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)">Kerberos</a> key exchange into a
separate set of packages, though not until after the Debian&nbsp;13
("trixie") release expected next year. The impact on Debian users
should be minimal, but it is an interesting look into the changes
Linux distributions make to upstream software as well as some of the
long-term consequences of those choices.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/990918/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Danilo Krummrich gave a talk at Kangrejos 2024 focusing on the question of how
the Rust-for-Linux project could improve at getting device and driver
abstractions upstream. As a case study, he used some of his recent work that
attempts to make it possible to write a PCI driver entirely in Rust. There
wasn't time to go into as much detail as he would have liked, but he did
demonstrate that it is possible to interface with the kernel's module loader in
a way that is much harder to
screw up than the current standard approach in C.

            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/922405/">extensible scheduler class (sched_ext)</a>
enables the implementation of CPU schedulers as a set of BPF programs
loaded from user space; it first hit the mailing lists in late 2022.
Sched_ext has engendered its share of controversy since, but is currently
slated to be part of the 6.12 kernel release.  At the 2024 <a
href="https://lpc.events/">Linux Plumbers Conference</a>, the growing
sched_ext community held one of its first public gatherings; sched_ext
would appear to have launched a new burst of creativity in scheduler
design.]]></description>

<blockquote class="bq">
In previous Julia versions, there was no "programmatic way" of knowing if an unexported name was considered part of the public API or not. Instead, the guideline was basically that if it was not in the manual then it was not public which was a bit underwhelming. To remedy that, there is now a <tt>public</tt> keyword in Julia that can be used to indicate that an unexported name is part of the public API.

            <title>oath-toolkit: privilege escalation in pam_oath.so (SUSE Security Team Blog)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/992948/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The SUSE Security Team Blog has a <a
href="https://security.opensuse.org/2024/10/04/oath-toolkit-vulnerability.html">detailed
report</a> on its discovery of <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/security/CVE-2024-47191/">a privilege escalation</a> in the
<a
href="https://gitlab.com/oath-toolkit/oath-toolkit">oath-toolkit</a>,
which provides libraries and utilities for managing one-time password
(OTP) authentication.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Fellow SUSE engineer Fabian Vogt approached our Security Team about
the project's PAM module. A couple of years ago, the module gained a
feature which allows to place the OTP state file (called usersfile) in
the home directory of the to-be-authenticated user. Fabian noticed
that the PAM module performs unsafe file operations in users' home
directories. Since PAM stacks typically run as root, this can easily
cause security issues.
