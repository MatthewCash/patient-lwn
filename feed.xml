            <title>Evolving the ASF Brand (Apache Software Foundation blog)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982392/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> (ASF)
has <a
href="https://news.apache.org/foundation/entry/evolving-the-asf-brand">announced</a>
that it will be changing its logo to remove the feather that has been part
of its brand since 1997.  ASF members will have input on the rebranding process and be
able to vote on the new logo, which will be unveiled at the <a href="https://communityovercode.org/">Community Over Code</a> conference in October.

<blockquote class="bq">
The feather is a well-loved and iconic part of the ASF brand. We know of community members who have ASF feather tattoos. People love taking photos with the feather at our flagship event each year. 
<p>
So why would we change it? As a non-Indigenous entity, we acknowledge that it is inappropriate for the Foundation to use Indigenous themes or language. We thank <a href="https://blog.nativesintech.org/apache-appropriation/">Natives in Tech</a> and other members of the broader open source community for bringing this issue to the forefront. Today we are announcing we will be retiring the feather icon and logo and replacing it with a new logo that embodies the Foundation's rich history of providing software for the public good.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981155/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The eventfs filesystem provides an interface to the tracepoints that are available
to be used by various Linux tracing tools (e.g. ftrace, perf, uprobes,
etc.); it is meant to be a version of the tracefs filesystem that
dynamically allocates its entries as needed.  The goal is to reduce the memory
required for multiple instances of tracefs, as Steven Rostedt described in
a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/895111/">session</a> at the 2022
<a
href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>.  He returned to the 2024
edition of the summit to talk further about how to make pseudo (or virtual)
filesystems, such as tracefs/eventfs, more like regular Linux filesystems,
where the directory entries (dentries) and inodes are only created (and
cached) as needed.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[There are a number of kernel filesystems that store their directory entries
directly in the directory-entry cache (dcache) without having any permanent
storage for those objects. It started out as a "neat hack" for <a

of this technique has grown into other filesystems, there has been a lot of

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/980430/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/google/psp">
PSP security protocol</a> (PSP) is a way to transparently encrypt packets by
efficiently offloading encryption and decryption to the network
interface cards (NICs) that Google uses for connections inside its data centers. The
protocol is similar to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec">
IPsec</a>, in that it allows for wrapping arbitrary traffic
in a layer of encryption. The difference is that PSP is encapsulated in UDP, and
designed from the beginning to reduce the amount of state that NICs
have to track in order to send and receive encrypted traffic, allowing for more
simultaneous connections. Jakub Kicinski
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/netdev/20240510030435.120935-1-kuba@kernel.org/">
wants to add support</a> for the protocol to the Linux kernel.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979789/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="https://www.devconf.info/cz/">DevConf.cz 2024</a>,
Marta Lewandowska gave a talk to discuss a
new approach for booting Linux systems, "<a
href="https://pretalx.com/devconf-cz-2024/talk/W3AVCT/">No more boot
loader: Please use the kernel instead</a>". The talk, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywrSDLp926M">available on
YouTube</a>, introduced a new project called nmbl (for "no more bootloader",
pronounced "nimble"). The idea is to get rid of bootloaders (e.g., 
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GNU GRUB</a>) with a
<a
href="https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/unified_kernel_image/">Unified
Kernel Image</a> (UKI) that removes the need for a separate bootloader
altogether. It is early days for nmbl, currently the project is only
being tested for use with virtual machines, but the idea is
compelling. If successful, nmbl could offer security, performance, and
maintenance benefits compared to GRUB and other separate bootloaders.</p>]]></description>

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/979870/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
ISO releases new <span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++</span>
language standards on a three-year cadence; now that it's been
more than a year since the finalization of
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++23</span>, we have a good idea of what
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/26">
features could be adopted for
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++26</span></a> — although proposals can
still be submitted until January 2025. Of particular interest is the addition of
support for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_pointer">
hazard pointers</a> and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/573424/">
user-space read-copy-update</a> (RCU).
Even though <span style="white-space:nowrap;">C++26</span> is not yet a standard, many of the proposed features are already
available to experiment with in GCC or Clang.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/979524/">
Redox</a> has <a href="https://www.redox-os.org/news/kernel-11/">received a
grant</a> to work on implementing POSIX-compatible signals. The
<a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/4lDO2/rfcs/-/blob/signals/text/0000-userspace-signals.md">
draft design</a> calls for them to be implemented nearly completely in user space.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
So far, the signals project has been going according to plan, and
hopefully, POSIX support for signals will be mostly complete by the
end of summer, with in-kernel improvements to process management.
After that, work on the userspace process manager will begin,
possibly including new kernel performance and/or functionality
improvements to facilitate this.

            <title>The 6.10 kernel has been released</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981961/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Linus has
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/981966/">released
the 6.10 kernel</a>.
<P>
<blockquote class="bq">
	So the final week was perhaps not quote as quiet as the preceding
	ones, which I don't love - but it also wasn't noisy enough to
	warrant an extra rc.
</blockquote>
<p>

Changes in 6.10 include
the removal of support for some ancient Alpha CPUs,
shadow-stack support for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32</a> sub-architecture,
Rust-language support on RISC-V systems,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/961884/">support</a> for some Windows NT synchronization
primitives (though it is marked "broken" in 6.10),
the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958438/"><tt>mseal()</tt> system call</a>,
<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/fsverity.html">fsverity</a>
support in the FUSE filesystem subsystem,
<tt>ioctl()</tt> support in the <a
href="https://docs.kernel.org/security/landlock.html">Landlock</a> security
module,
the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/974380/">memory-allocation profiling</a> subsystem,
and more.

            <title>GNOME Foundation Announces Transition of Executive Director</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/981850/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/">GNOME Foundation</a> has <a
href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2024/07/12/gnome-foundation-announces-transition-of-executive-director/">announced</a>
that executive director Holly Million is stepping down at the end of
July, and will be replaced by Richard Littauer as interim executive
director:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>On behalf of the whole GNOME community, the Board of Directors
would like to give our utmost thanks to Holly for her achievements
during the past 10 months, including drafting a bold five-year
strategic plan for the Foundation, securing two important fiscal
sponsorship agreements with GIMP and Black Python Devs, writing our
first funding proposal that will now enable the Foundation to apply
for more grants, vastly improving our financial operations, and
implementing a break-even budget to preserve our financial
reserves.</p>

<p>The Foundation's Interim Executive Director, Richard Littauer,
brings years of open source leadership as part of his work as an
organizer of SustainOSS and CURIOSS, as a sustainability coordinator
at the Open Source Initiative, and as a community development manager
at Open Source Collective, and through open source contributions to
many projects, such as Node.js and IPFS. The Board appointed Richard
in June and is confident in his ability to guide the Foundation during
this transitional period.
</blockquote>

<p>Million says she is leaving to pursue a PhD in psychology. The
board plans to announce its search plan for a permanent executive
directory after <a
href="https://events.gnome.org/event/209/">GUADEC</a>, which takes
place July 19 through 24.</p>
