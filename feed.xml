            <title>Garrett: What is an SBAT and why does everyone suddenly care</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/986844/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Matthew Garrett <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/70348.html">describes
the role of the Secure Boot Advanced Targeting mechanism</a> and how it
played into the recent Windows upgrade problems.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	So why is this suddenly relevant? SBAT was developed
	collaboratively between the Linux community and Microsoft, and
	Microsoft chose to push a Windows update that told systems not to
	trust versions of grub with a security generation below a certain
	level. This was because those versions of grub had genuine security
	vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to compromise the
	Windows secure boot chain, and we've seen real world examples of
	malware wanting to do that.

            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/982868/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
Rust is intended to let programmers write safer code.
But compilers are
not omniscient, and writing Rust code that interfaces with hardware (or that
works with memory outside of Rust's lifetime paradigm) requires, at
some point, the programmer's assurance that some operations are permissible. Benno Lossin
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240717221133.459589-1-benno.lossin@proton.me/">
suggested adding
some more documentation</a> to
<a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">
the Rust-for-Linux project</a> clarifying the
standards for commenting uses of <tt>unsafe</tt> in kernel code. There's general
agreement that such standards are necessary, but less agreement on exactly when
it is appropriate to use <tt>unsafe</tt>.

versions of PostgreSQL 17 containing several interesting security and usability
improvements, alongside the usual performance improvements and bug fixes. If the
release proceeds according to the usual timeline, the full release of version 17
is expected in September or October.
The most important changes are in what PostgreSQL does when a database
supervisor has their credentials revoked, and added
support for incremental database backups.

Committee</a> (TC) take the stage to talk about the work that the committee
does—and more.  <a href="https://debconf24.debconf.org/">DebConf24</a> in
Busan, South Korea was no exception, as TC chair Sean Whitton, who
will complete his term at the end of the year, and one
of its newest members, Stefano Rivera, described the constitutional
underpinnings of the TC, how it tries to make decisions when it needs to,
and the constant process of recruiting new members.  After that, they took
a few questions from the audience.  The session provided a nice overview of
the TC and its role in Debian, but it may well be of interest further afield.]]></description>

            <title>[$] Distinguishing Debian testing from unstable</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/984635/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Sometimes, the smallest changes create the longest discussions.  As a case
in point, a proposal to make a one-line change in an informational text
file on systems running the Debian unstable distribution has blown up into
an interminable and sometimes unfriendly debate.  At its core, though, this
discussion comes down to a seemingly simple question: should a program be
able to determine whether it is running on a Debian testing or unstable
system?]]></description>

            <title>[$] Endless OS aimed at educational and offline environments</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/984086/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://www.endlessos.org/os">
Endless OS</a> is a Linux distribution with a focus on improving access to
educational tools by providing a simple-to-manage, full-featured desktop for
educators and students — one that works offline, with minimal maintenance. The
distribution also aims to be suitable for older devices, in order to promote access to
computers by ensuring those systems remain usable.
In pursuit of those goals, it makes some unusual technical
choices. But what makes the distribution really shine is its curated collection
of software and educational resources.

            <title>“Something has gone seriously wrong,” dual-boot systems warn after Microsoft update (ars technica)</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/986659/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ars technica <a
href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/08/a-patch-microsoft-spent-2-years-preparing-is-making-a-mess-for-some-linux-users/">covers</a>
a recent <a
href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2022-2601">update</a>
that is causing problems for users with systems that dual-boot Windows
and Linux.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>"Note that Windows says this update won't apply to systems that
dual-boot Windows and Linux," one frustrated person wrote. "This
obviously isn't true, and likely depends on your system configuration
and the distribution being run. It appears to have made some linux efi
shim bootloaders incompatible with microcrap efi bootloaders (that's
why shifting from MS efi to 'other OS' in efi setup works). It appears
that Mint has a shim version that MS SBAT doesn't recognize."</p>

<p>The reports indicate that multiple distributions, including Debian,
Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, and Puppy Linux, are all
affected. Microsoft has yet to acknowledge the error publicly, explain
how it wasn't detected during testing, or provide technical guidance
to those affected. Company representatives didn't respond to an email
seeking answers.</p>

            <title>Górny: Gentoo: profiles and keywords rather than releases</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/986655/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Gentoo developer Michał Górny has written a lengthy <a
href="https://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2024/08/20/gentoo-profiles-and-keywords-rather-than-releases/">blog
post</a> that explains how Gentoo approaches releases:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Gentoo is something of a hybrid, as it combines the best of both
worlds. It is a rolling release distribution with a single shared
repository that is available to all users. However, within this
repository we use a keywording system to provide a choice between
stable and testing packages, to facilitate both production and
development systems (with some extra flexibility), and versioned
profiles to tackle major lock-step upgrades.
