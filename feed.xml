            <title>Vanilla OS 2 - future plans, updates, and next release</title>
            <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/991722/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://vanillaos.org/">Vanilla OS</a> project has
published <a
href="https://vanillaos.org/blog/article/2024-09-25/vanilla-os-2---future-plans-updates-and-next-release">a
blog post</a> to answer questions that users have raised since the release of <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/989629/">Vanilla OS 2</a>. The post has information about the update strategy for the distribution,
an <a href="https://vanillaos.org/enterprise-support">enterprise
version with support</a>, and plans for an experimental version called
Vanilla OS Vision.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>We are not planning for a potential Vanilla OS 3 because it is not
yet necessary. As previously explained, our focus right now is on bug
fixing and making the system as solid as possible, especially in light
of collaborations with OEMs. We're all excited about laying the
foundation for a third version of Vanilla OS, but we have
responsibilities to attend to first.</p>

<p>This does not mean that there will never be one, nor does it mean
that Orchid will become stagnant. On the contrary, as previously
mentioned, our updates not only bring fixes but also updates to system
components, improvements to existing features, and updates to
components like GNOME (we are planning the release of GNOME 47 soon,
for example).</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Henceforth, breaking changes to documented parts of the language

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
The OpenSSH project has <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.9">released</a> version 9.9. This version includes support for the

The release also includes
the next step in the deprecation of DSA keys â€” they are now disabled by default at compile time,
and are expected to be removed entirely in early 2025. The release also contains the normal mixture of bug fixes and small usability improvements.

On September 19, Thomas Gleixner delivered the pull request for the
realtime preemption enablement patches to Linus Torvalds â€” in printed form,
wrapped in gold, with a ribbon, as Torvalds had requested.  It was a
significant milestone, marking the completion of a project that required
20&nbsp;years of effort.  Congratulations are due to everybody involved.
<p>
Torvalds <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/baeb9a7d8b60">acted on</a>

            <description><![CDATA[The Python community has been roiled, to a certain extent, by an <a

<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">PEP&nbsp;20</a> ("The Zen of

guesses about what the demands on the system will be in the future, it
remains reliant on heuristics, despite ongoing efforts to remove them.
Some of those heuristics take special note of tasks that are (or appear to
be) waiting for fast I/O operations.  There is some unhappiness, though,
with how this factor is used, leading to a couple of patches taking rather
different approaches to improve the situation.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Code review is in high demand, and short supply, for most open-source projects.
Reviewer time is precious, so any tool that can lighten the load is worth exploring.
That is why Jesse Brandeburg and Kamel Ayari decided to test whether
tools like ChatGPT could review patches to provide quick feedback to
contributors about common problems. In <a
href="https://netdevconf.info/0x18/sessions/talk/ai-enhanced-reviews-for-linux-networking.html">a
talk</a> at the <a href="https://netdevconf.info/0x18/">Netdev
0x18</a> conference this July, Brandeburg provided an overview of an
experiment using machine learning to review emails containing patches
sent to the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.6/networking/netdev-FAQ.html">netdev</a>
mailing list. Large-language models (LLMs) will not be replacing human reviewers anytime
soon, but they may be a useful addition to help humans focus on deeper
reviews instead of simple rule violations.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch">OpenSnitch</a> is an
"<q>interactive application firewall</q>". Like other firewalls, it uses a
series of rules to decide what network traffic should be permitted. Unlike
many other firewalls, though, OpenSnitch does not ask the user to create a list of rules
ahead of time. Instead, the list of rules can be built up
incrementally as applications make connections â€” and the user can peruse both
the rules that have built up over time, and statistics on the connections that
have been attempted.
