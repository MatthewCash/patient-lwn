The kernel's <a\nhref=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrandom.2.html\"><tt>getrandom()</tt></a>\nsystem call might, after years of discussion, be seen as sufficiently\nsecure by most users, but it is still a system call.  Linux system calls\nare relatively fast, but they are necessarily slower than calling a\nfunction directly.  In an attempt to speed the provision of secure random\ndata to user space, Jason Donenfeld has put together <a\nhref=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240703183115.1075219-1-Jason@zx2c4.com\">an\nimplementation of <tt>getrandom()</tt></a> that lives in the <a\nhref=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html\">virtual dynamic\nshared object (vDSO) area</a>.","dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["corbet"],"dates":[],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":[],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":[],"subjects":[],"titles":[],"types":[]},"enclosure":null,"extensions":{},"guid":{"permalink":true,"value":"https://lwn.net/Articles/980447/"},"itunes_ext":null,"link":"https://lwn.net/Articles/980447/","pub_date":"Thu, 04 Jul 2024 16:30:56 +0000","source":null,"title":"[$] Another try for getrandom() in the vDSO"},"published":null},{"article_type":"Free","guid":{"permalink":true,"value":"https://lwn.net/Articles/980856/"},"item":{"author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"content":null,"description":"<p>\nGreg Kroah-Hartman has announced the release of seven more stable kernels.\nVersions <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/980859/\">6.9.8</a>,\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/980860/\">6.9.37</a>,\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/980861/\">6.1.97</a>,\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/980862/\">5.15.162</a>,\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/980863/\">5.10.221</a>,\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/980864/\">5.4.279</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/980865/\">4.19.317</a> are now available.\n</p>","dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["daroc"],"dates":[],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":[],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":[],"subjects":[],"titles":[],"types":[]},"enclosure":null,"extensions":{},"guid":{"permalink":true,"value":"https://lwn.net/Articles/980856/"},"itunes_ext":null,"link":"https://lwn.net/Articles/980856/","pub_date":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 12:34:46 +0000","source":null,"title":"Seven new stable kernels"},"published":"2024-07-05T12:45:03.700665146Z"},{"article_type":"Free","guid":{"permalink":true,"value":"https://lwn.net/Articles/980855/"},"item":{"author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"content":null,"description":"Security updates have been issued by <b>Fedora</b> (cockpit, python-astropy, python3-docs, and python3.12), <b>Gentoo</b> (BusyBox, GNU Coreutils, GraphicsMagick, podman, PuTTY, Sofia-SIP, TigerVNC, and WebKitGTK+), <b>Mageia</b> (chromium-browser-stable and openvpn), <b>SUSE</b> (cockpit, krb5, and netatalk), and <b>Ubuntu</b> (kopanocore, libreoffice, linux-aws, linux-oem-6.8, linux-aws-5.15, linux-azure, linux-azure-4.15, linux-lowlatency, linux-lowlatency-hwe-6.5, linux-oracle, linux-starfive-6.5, and virtuoso-opensource).","dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["daroc"],"dates":[],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":[],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":[],"subjects":[],"titles":[],"types":[]},"enclosure":null,"extensions":{},"guid":{"permalink":true,"value":"https://lwn.net/Articles/980855/"},"itunes_ext":null,"link":"https://lwn.net/Articles/980855/","pub_date":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 12:17:25 +0000","source":null,"title":"Security updates for Friday"},"published":"2024-07-05T12:45:03.700670376Z"},{"article_type":{"Paid":"2024-07-18T00:00:00Z"},"guid":{"permalink":true,"value":"https://lwn.net/Articles/979870/"},"item":{"author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"content":null,"description":"<p>\nISO releases new <span style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">C++</span>\nlanguage standards on a three-year cadence; now that it's been\nmore than a year since the finalization of\n<span style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">C++23</span>, we have a good idea of what\n<a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/26\">\nfeatures could be adopted for\n<span style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">C++26</span></a> — although proposals can\nstill be submitted until January 2025.
