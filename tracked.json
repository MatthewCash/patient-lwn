Within those projects, there is a fair amount\nof latitude about how changes are managed, and some subsystems are using\nthat freedom in the search for more efficient ways of working.  In the end,\nthough, all of these sub-projects have to work together and interface with\nkernel-wide efforts, including the stable-release and CVE-assignment\nprocesses.  For some time, there has been friction between the direct\nrendering (DRM, or graphics) subsystem and the stable maintainers; that\nfriction recently burst into view in a way that shows some of the\nlimitations of how the kernel community manages patches.","dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["corbet"],"dates":[],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":[],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":[],"subjects":[],"titles":[],"types":[]},"enclosure":null,"extensions":{},"guid":{"permalink":true,"value":"https://lwn.net/Articles/1005222/"},"itunes_ext":null,"link":"https://lwn.net/Articles/1005222/","pub_date":"Thu, 16 Jan 2025 19:14:43 +0000","source":null,"title":"The many names of commit 55039832f98c"},"published":"2025-01-16T19:21:37.913585149Z"},{"article_type":"Free","guid":{"permalink":true,"value":"https://lwn.net/Articles/1005380/"},"item":{"author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"content":null,"description":"<p>\nThe\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1005382/\">6.12.10</a>,\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1005383/\">6.6.72</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1005386/\">6.1.125</a> stable kernels have been released on\nthe expected schedule. \n</p>","dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["daroc"],"dates":[],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":[],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":[],"subjects":[],"titles":[],"types":[]},"enclosure":null,"extensions":{},"guid":{"permalink":true,"value":"https://lwn.net/Articles/1005380/"},"itunes_ext":null,"link":"https://lwn.net/Articles/1005380/","pub_date":"Fri, 17 Jan 2025 14:02:03 +0000","source":null,"title":"Three stable kernel updates, as expected"},"published":"2025-01-17T14:10:00.911726834Z"},{"article_type":"Free","guid":{"permalink":true,"value":"https://lwn.net/Articles/1005433/"},"item":{"author":null,"categories":[],"comments":null,"content":null,"description":"Security updates have been issued by <b>Debian</b> (rsync and tomcat9), <b>Fedora</b> (chromium, mingw-python-jinja2, redict, and valkey), <b>Gentoo</b> (GIMP and pip), <b>Oracle</b> (.NET, fence-agents, ipa, kernel, python-virtualenv, raptor2, and rsync), <b>Red Hat</b> (.NET 8.0 and .NET 9.0), <b>SUSE</b> (apache2-mod_jk, git, git-lfs, kernel, python-Django, thunderbird, and xen), and <b>Ubuntu</b> (audacity, bcel, dotnet8, dotnet9, gimp-dds, harfbuzz, libxml2, poppler, rsync, and tqdm).","dublin_core_ext":{"contributors":[],"coverages":[],"creators":["daroc"],"dates":[],"descriptions":[],"formats":[],"identifiers":[],"languages":[],"publishers":[],"relations":[],"rights":[],"sources":[],"subjects":[],"titles":[],"types":[]},"enclosure":null,"extensions":{},"guid":{"permalink":true,"value":"https://lwn.net/Articles/1005433/"},"itunes_ext":null,"link":"https://lwn.net/Articles/1005433/","pub_date":"Fri, 17 Jan 2025 14:01:35 +0000","source":null,"title":"Security updates for Friday"},"published":"2025-01-17T14:10:00.911768943Z"}]
