In short, while Git guards against newline characters\n(<tt>\\n</tt>) being injected into a repository's URL, some programming languages\nalso treat carriage return characters (<tt>\\r</tt>) as being newlines. Adding a\ncarriage return to a repository's URL can cause Git and the credential manager\nto disagree on how the URL should be parsed, ultimately resulting in Git\ncredentials being sent to the wrong host. Malicious repositories could include\nGit submodules with malformed URLs, triggering the bug. Only password-based authentication\nwith an external credential manager is\nvulnerable to this attack; SSH-based authentication remains secure.
